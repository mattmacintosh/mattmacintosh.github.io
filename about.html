					<p>Matt Macintosh is a Kamloops–based artist working with found images and objects, painting, video and sound. His work explores the effects of erasure, systematization and repetition on cultural canon materials as they relate to fundamental human experiences like the longing for emancipation. Currently Curator at the Kamloops Museum and Archives, he has exhibited in Canada and the US.</p>
