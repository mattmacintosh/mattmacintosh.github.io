Pancavimsatisahasrikaprajnaparamita-sutra (in short, PPS) The original text has not come down to us, but it is known by a partially abridged Chinese version, the Ta tche tou louen (T 1509), executed between 402 and 406 AD at Tchang-ngan by the Serindian master Kumarajiva This version comprises two series of chapters: 1 A first series of fifty-two chapters (T 1509, p 57c-314b), gathered into an initial chapter bearing the numeral I 2 A second series of eighty-nine chapters (T 1509, p 314b-756c), numbered from II to XC The first series appears to be an integral version of the Indian original, the second series as an abridged version My [Lamotte] work, the Traite de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse, which presently consists of five volumes, published at Louvain between 1944 and 1980, is a French translation of the fifty-two chapters of the first series and chapter XX of the second series In the course of chapters XLIX to LII of the present volume, volume V, the bodhisattva of the PPS continues to adorn his future buddha-field by formulating a series of vows, the success of which absolutely requires the practice of the Prajnaparamita To the twenty-four vows already formulated in chapters XLII to XLVII of volume IV, thirty-eight further vows are about to be added here The great aspiration (adhyasaya) of the bodhisattva knows no limits and if all his wishes were realized, some least expected consequences would result Thus, if a single sermon would suffice to establish all beings in Buddhahood, what would still be the need for innumerable Tathagatas who follow one another in the world in order to put an end to universal suffering? To want to establish all beings in Buddhahood all at once would result in the interruption of the lineage of the Buddhas (buddhavamsasamuccheda), something no-one would want But such considerations are valid only in relative truth From the point of view of absolute truth, the vows of the bodhisattva are fully justified and completely realizable Even more so, they have already been realized In the view of the Prajna, beings are empty of me and of mine, , dharmas are without intrinsic nature and specific characteristic Their true nature is absence of characteristic The Prajnaparamita alone penetrates it and penetrates it by not cognizing it, for it is free of any opinion Since there is nothing to hope for, the wise man wishes for nothing and, in this sense, all his wishes are realized before being formulated Furthermore, the wise man, having no substantial reality, is nothing but a name To these wishes the Upadesa dedicates commentaries that have the precision and technique of an Abhidharma treatise; it multiplies references to the sutras of the Lesser Vehicle as well as to those of the 1772Greater Vehicle In its eyes, both the Tripitaka and the Mahayanasutras are the Words of the Buddha, but it is in the PPS that the Buddha spoke most clearly of the true nature of dharmas (p 2189F) The problem of causality is tackled in chapter XLIX where it is said that the bodhisattva wishes to understand the four conditions (p 2170F) There the Upadesa sees an allusion to a system of causality where four conditions (pratyaya) and six causes (hetu) play a part in the production and cessation of conditioned dharmas The canonical sutras had already placed the bases for them; the Abhidharmas and the Sarvastivadin school had formulated them in their definitive form Nagarjuna was familiar with them and struggled with them energetically in the first chapter of his Mulamadhyamakakarikas where he showed the absurdity of the four conditions The author of the Upadesa adopts a more balanced position: he refrains from any futile proliferation about causes and conditions, but determines that they produce nothing Thus they are neither to be taken up nor rejected The Upadesa will return twice (p 2186F, 2232F) to the problem of dharmata and its synonyms For the sravakas, it was pratityasamutpada, the conditioned production and cessation of the five skandhas For the Madhyamikas, it is exactly the opposite, the true nature of things excluding all production and all cessation We will notice (p 2198-99F) the distinction established between the lower, middling and higher tathata, as the prthagjana, the sravaka and the bodhisattva, respectively, understood it A problem which was scarcely of any interest to the early masters but which subsequently gained importance is that of the vision of the Buddhas, treated in chapter L Sakyamuni’s contemporaries saw the Buddha with their fleshly eye (mamsacaksus), the range of which is very limited More ambitious, the bodhisattvas of the PPS wanted to see, with the divine eye (divyacaksus), the innumerable Buddhas reigning in the ten directions (p 2272F) The divyacaksus obtained by practice of the superknowledges consists of a subtle matter derived from the ten great elements; it enjoys a perfect luminosity to the four directions of the horizon Other Mahayanasutras, contemporary with the PPS but seeming not to have been influenced by them, propose another process of seeing: the pratyutpannasamadhi, a technique of mental concentration by means of which an ascetic, even without using the divyacaksus, is able to contemplate, as in a dream, the Buddhas of the present, mainly Amitabha, and to converse with them A controversy on the efficacy of these two processes arose in India, probably in Kasmir, at the time of the Upadesa Brought to expressing a position, its author does not hide his preferences for the divyacksus (p 2273-2274F), the more traditional process fitting into the frame of the Abhijnas But the Buddhas are but names (namamatra) and it is by eliminating wrong views that one is able to see them in their body of the doctrine (p 2265F) The controversy which, in India, set the partisans of the divyacaksus in opposition to those of the pratyutpannasamadhi was triggered off again in China in the first quarter of the 5th century It provoked an interesting exchange of correspondence between Houei-yuan, the master of Mount Lou, and Kumarajiva, the translator of the Upadesa (p 2270-72F) 1773In the canonical sources, there is frequent mention of the kinds of literary composition borrowed by the Words of the Buddha - these are nine or twelve in number, sutras, etc; the early sources enumerate them without defining them In chapter LI, the bodhisattvas of the PPS wish to hear and retain the twelve- membered Word of the Buddha (p 2286F) Along with the Mahavibhasa of the arhats of Kasmir, the Upadesa is among the first exegetical treatises that attempt to give an explanation of them It tries to introduce into it the entire group of Buddhist scriptures existing at its time (p 2389F) in order to establish its canonicity But Buddhist literature had expanded so much that it lent itself poorly to this kind of distribution The explanations furnished in regard to certain angas, such as the Udana and especially the Itivrttaka, must have perplexed the Chinese readers, and we do not pride ourselves in having dissipated all the obscurities here In early times, hearing the name of the Buddhas (buddhanamadheyasravana) was not included among the auxiliary dharmas of bodhi (bodhipaksikadharma) Some disciples of Sakyamuni, such as the notable Sudatta or the brahmana Saila, were overcome by joy on hearing the word Buddha’ pronounced, but nevertheless did not progress along the path of salvation In the centuries that followed, the Name unceasingly gained in importance In chapter LII of the PPS, the bodhisattva formulates the following vow: When I have attained supreme complete enlightenment, may innumerable beings, as soon as they hear my name, be established in abhisambodhi (p 2352F) At the same time, other Mahayanasutras, such as the Sukhavativyuha and the Lotus, say that merely hearing the name of buddha Amitabha or bodhisattva Avalakitesvara assured, ipso facto, rebirth in Sukhavati, or puts an end to suffering In the Chinese and Japanese extensions of Amidism, the invocation to Amitabha (the Nan wou pou k’o sseu yi kouang jou lai, Namo-amida-butsu) constitutes the easiest and most efficacious means of salvation for the devotee The author of the Upadesa is not of this opinion According to him, the hearing of the name is not the single means of realizing salvation, is not infallible, and does not immediately produce its effects like a cintamani or a magical spell (p 2358-63F) Without condemning the mystics, it rather sides with the rationalists, that category of disciples who see the profound reality (arthapada) by penetrating it by means of prajna, by means of the intellect (Anguttara, III, p 355) Rationalism can go hand in hand with traditionalism Concerned about dealing carefully with the old beliefs, the author on occasion rises up against the excessiveness of the Prajna or rather against the erroneous interpretations that might be proposed of it Thus the Mahayanists believe in the transfer of merit (punyaparinamana): according to them, it would be possible to apply the merits that one has gained oneself to others (p 1879-80F), and the bodhisattva of the PPS wishes, by means of his own power, to assure good rebirths to beings (p 2312F) But at first sight, the notion of transfer of merit seems to contradict the law of karma universally accepted by the Indians How can the transfer of merit be accepted when, according to the earliest texts, actions are declared to be strictly personal and incommunicable? Good and bad actions ripen for their doer, and no one else can bear their consequences That being so, how could beings benefit from an action carried out by the bodhisattva? The Upadesa tries to reconcile the two opposing doctrines with the following reasoning: By the power of his knowledge, wondrous deeds and sermons, the bodhisattva makes beings themselves carry out the good actions that will win them good 1774rebirths (p 2312F) Thus, far from being useless, the intervention of the bodhisattva is eminently beneficial The Upadesa ends the last chapter (LII) of the first series with a vibrant eulogy of the Prajnaparamita The PPS’s, long before, had proclaimed her to be Mother of the Buddhas because she reveals the true nature of the loka (lokadharmatasamdarsayaitri) By loka we should understand the five skandhas or psycho- physical aggregates of existence Why are they called loka? Because of the etymology But two distinct etymologies have been proposed The canonical sutras (Samyutta, IV, p 52) attaching loka to the root luji to break’ say that the skandhas are loka insofar as they are broken or disaggregated (lujyante va pralujyante va) and their true nature (dharmata) is their dependent production and cessation (pratityasamutpada) The PPS’s propose another etymology involving a diametrically opposite interpretation Loka, according to them, is derived from the root loki to shine’, and the skandhas are loka insofar as they do not break and do not disaggregate (na lujyante na pralujyante); consequently, their true nature is non-production (anutpada) and non-cessation (anirodha), quite the contrary of pratityasamutpada One would hardly know how better to mark the doctrinal rift separating the two Vehicles: the sravakas recognized the noble truths of the origin and cessation of suffering (samudaya- and nirodha-satya), whereas the bodhisattvas are established in the conviction that things do not arise (anutpattikadharmaksanti) But for both of them, peace is nirvana (santam nirvanam) To the metaphor of Mother of the Buddhas, frequent in the PPS’s, the Upadesa adds that of Father of the Buddhas, the latter being inspired by other Mahayanasutras The Father of the Buddhas would be the pratyutapannasamadhi, the visualization of the Buddhas of the present, which has already been mentioned above In the fathering of infants, the mother has a more important rôle than the father; similarly, in regard to the formation of the Buddhas, the pratyutpannasamadhi is overshadowed by prajna: This samadhi can only concentrate the distracted mind in such a way that prajna is produced, but it cannot see the true nature (dharmata) of things The Prajnaparamita alone is able to see all the dharmas completely and to discern their true nature: there is nothing it does not penetrate, nothing it does not realize; its qualities are so great that it is called Mother(p 2369F) Chapter XX of the Pancavimsatisahasrika (ed N Dutt, p 214, l 6 to 225, l 19; T 223, k 6, p 256c-259c) entitled Mahayanasamprasthana Setting out for the Mahayana’ deals with the ten bhumis, stages in the bodhisattva career It consists of two parts: the first is a simple list enumerating the things the bodhisattva must do and avoid in order to pass from bhumi to bhumi; the second part is a gloss repeating each of the things and adding brief explanations In the French translation that follows, these two parts are put together into a single one and the explanations are incorporated directly into the list, in order to give a more synthetic view of the materials and avoid tedious repetitions 1775Although Kumarajiva translated it only as a summary, the commentary of the Upadesa on this chapter is not lacking in interest Its author interprets the doctrines of the Prajnaparamitasutra in the light of the Avatamsaka and, more particularly, of the Dasabhumikasutra The bodhisattva should fulfill his career in two ways, either by traveling the ten bhumis proper reserved for him, Pramudita, etc, or by borrowing the ten shared bhumis, Suklavidarsana, etc, shared by the sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, the bodhisattvas and the Buddhas Finally, the Upadesa was one of the first treatises to establish a parallel between the bhumis of the bodhisattva and the conquest of the four fruits of religious life (sramanyaphala), srotaapattiphala, etc, mentioned by the canonical sources The five volumes of the Traite represent only a third of the Upadesa which Kumarajiva translated completely into Chinese With the chapter on the bhumis, they give a sufficiently complete idea of Buddhist gnosis at the beginning of the 4th century of our era It is my [Lamotte] pleasure to express publicly my deep appreciation to colleagues and friends who have helped me in the present work and without whose aid the latter could not have been brought to term The interest which Japan has always held for the Daichidoron (Upadesa) has been extended to the French translation of the Traite de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse: the encouragements to me, which have been lavish, from the East as well as from the West, sustained me in my work which was greatly facilitated by the progress in Buddhist studies in the course of the recent years Volumes IV and V have benefited from working tools (editions of texts, dictionaries, concordances, indexes and encyclopedias) made specially for the use of researchers But all the secrets of the Upadesa, however, have not been elucidated , far from it; and the enrichment of our documentations only sets new problems The final editing of volume V has been sensibly eased thanks to the devotion and ability of many of my friends Prof Dr Heinz Bechert (Göttingen) gave it attentive reading; Robert Shih (Louvain-la-Neuve), Hubert Durt (Kyoto) and Marcel Van Velthem (Brussels) assisted me efficiently in the correction of the proofs I give them my deepest thanks My appreciation is also expressed to the Fondation Universitaire de Belgique and to the Insitut Orientaliste de Louvain who generously helped with the expense of printing Brussels, December 8, 1979 1776SUPPLEMENT TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHY ed = edition;

from the production of this, that is produced (asmin satidam bhavaty asyotpadad idam utpadyate), and: This not being, that is not; by the cessation of this, that ceases (asminn asatidam na bhavaty asya nirodhad idam nirudhyate): cf Catusparisat, p 102, 358-360; Salistamba, ed N A Sastri, p 2; Avadanasataka, II, p 105-106: Arthaviniscaya, ed N H Samtani, p 5; Mahavastu, II, p 285, III, p 448; and for the Pali sources, Vin I, p 1; Majjhima, III, p 63; Samyutta, II, p 1, 25, etc 1782The Buddhist credo quite rightly continues with a single stanza infinitely reproduced on Indian, Serindian and Chinese monuments and images: Ye dhamma hetuppabhava tesam hetum tathagato aha | tesan ca yo nirodho evamvadi mahasamano || The Tathagata, the great ascetic, has told the cause of phenomena coming from causes, and he has also told their abolition But in the present section, it is more precisely a matter of the system of the four conditions and/or the six causes intervening in the functioning of causality Does this system already occur in the canonical sutras or, if not, which school elaborated it? Does the Madhyamaka accept or reject it? Do the Prajnaparamita sutras mention it and, if so, in what sense? Finally, how did the Traite understand it? 1 The system in the canonical sutras In the early texts the words condition’ (pratyaya) and cause’ (hetu) seem to be equivalent The Kosavyakhya, p 188, makes the following comment: What is the difference between hetu and pratyaya? There is none The Blessed One said: dvau hetu dvau pratyayau samyagdrster utpadaya katamau dvau paratas ca ghoso dhyatmam ca yoniso manaskara iti There are two causes, two conditions for the arising of right view What are these two? The speech of another and, inwardly, right reflection’ (cf Majjima, I, p 294, l 1-3; Anguttara, I, p87, l 32-34) The words hetu, pratyaya, nidana, karana, nimitta, linga, upanisad are synonymous But, asks the Mahavibhasa, why is it that the Jnanaprasthana of Katyayaniputra, after having spoken of the four pratyayas, still lists six hetus? Here is its answer (T 1545, k 16, p 79a26-c5): The six hetus are not spoken of in the sutras; the sutras speak only of the existence of the four pratyayas, namely, hetupratyaya up to adhipatipratyaya Here, in order to distinguish the hetus from the pratyayas, [the Jnanaprasthana] speaks of six hetus Question - Do the hetus contain the pratyayas and do the pratyayas contain <2165> the hetus? - Answer: They are contained mutually according to thir use Some say that the first five hetus are the hetupratyaya and that the karanahetu is the other three pratyayas Others say that the pratyayas contain the hetus, but that the hetus do not contain [all] the pratyayas: thus the first five hetus are the hetupratyaya; the karanahetu is the adhipatipratyaya, but the samanantarapratyaya and the alambanapratyaya are not contained in the hetus Others say that that it was also a question of the hetus in the sutras and, particularly, in the Ekottaragama, of the group of six (satkanipata), but in time, this text has disappeared (antarhita); however, the Sthavira Katyayaniputra, by the power of his knowledge resulting from an aspiration (pranidhijnana), saw this sutra passage where it was a matter of the six hetus and [as a result] he compiled and wrote his Abhidharma That is why, in this Abhidharma, he distinguishes the six hetus Formerly the Ekottaragamasutra listed 1783dharmas from 1 to 100 (ekottarikagama a satad dharmanirdesa asit); now it goes only from 1 to 10 (idanim tv a dasakad drsyanta iti), and the rest have disappeared Moreover, in the groups 1 to 10, much has disappeared and not much remains The Sthavira Sanakavasin, a great arhat, was a disciple contemporaneous with the Sthavira Ananda At that time, this Venerable was a faithful transmitter of the Bhagavat’s teachings, but, by the time of the nirvana of the arhat, 77,000 jatakas and sutras, 10,000 sastras had already disappeared If so many sutras and sastras disappeared under one scholar, what has not happened from that day until today when hundreds, thousands, of scholars have followed one after the other? How can the number of sutras and sastras that have been lost be known? This is why, some say, the six hetus are mentioned in the sutras Other teachers (acarya) say: Although there is no sutra where the six hetus are treated in order (anukramena) and fully (sampurnam), these hetus are mentioned separately (vikirnam) in various places in the sutras: 1 A sutra says: iyam ucyate darsanamulika sraddha vetyajnanasamprayukta It is what is called faith having seeing as root, ASSOCIATED with the knowledge [subsequent] to penetration’ Sutras of this kind have dealt with the samprayuktakahetu 2 A sutra says: caksuh pratitya rupani cotpadyate caksurvijnanam trayanam samgatih sparsah taih saha jata vedana samjna cetana ca As a result of the eye and visibles, there arises the visual consciousness; the meeting of the three is contact; there ARISE WITH them sensation, concept and volition’ (cf Majjhima, I, p 111, l 35037, p 281, l 18-29; Samyutta, II, p 72, l 4-5; IV, p 32, l 31-32; p 86, l 18-19; p 90, l 15- 16) Sutras of this kind have dealt with sahabhuhetu 3 A sutra says: samanvagato yam pudgalah kusalair api dharmair akusalair api asya khalu pudgalasya kusala dharma antarhita akusalaa dharmah sammukhibhutah asti casyanusahagatam kusalamulamasamucchinnam yato sya kusalabhavisyati This man is endowed with good and bad dharmas, but within him the good dharmas are disappearing and the bad dharmas are appearing But there is still within him a persistent root of good which is not cut and, from this root of good, there will grow ANOTHER root of good: thus, in the future, this man will be pure’ (cf Anguttara, III, p 404, l 12-20; Madhyama, T 26, k 27, p 601a22-27) Sutras of this kind have dealt with the sabhagahetu <2166> 4 A sutra asys: mithyadrsteh purusapudgalasya yac ca kayakarma yac ca vakkarma yac ca manaskarma yah pranidhih ye ca taddrster anvayah samskarah sarve py ete dharma anistatvaya samvartante kantatvayapriyatvayamanapatvaya [tat kasya hetoh drstir hy asya yad uta mithyadrstih] For the man who has a wrong view, every physical act, every vocal act, every mental act, every resolution and all the formations connected with this view: ALL these dharmas end up in delusion, unhappiness, affliction, disagreement [Why? Because he has a guilty view, namely, wrong view] - Cf Anguttara, V, p 212, l 20- 29; Samyukta, T 99, k 28, p 204a25-28 Sutras of this kind have dealt with the sarvatragahetu 5 A sutra says: asthanam etad anavakaso yat kayaduscaritasya vagduscaritasya manoduscaritasyestah kanto manapo vipaka nirvarteta sthanam ca kaly etad vidyate yad anisto kanto manapo vipako nirvarteta It is impossible, it is unrealizable that a physical, vocal or mental misdeed will result in an agreeable, nice, pleasant, RETRIBUTION, but it is certainly possible that there will result from it a disagreeable, lowly, 1784unpleasant retribution’ (cf Majjhima, III, p 66, l 9-28; Anguttara, I, p 28, l 23-24; madhyama, T 26, k 47, p 724b8-10) Sutras of this kind have dealt with the vipakahetu 6 A sutra says: dvau hetu dvau pratayau samyagdrster utpadaya: paratas ca ghoso dhyatmam ca yoniso manaskarah There are two causes, two conditions for the ARISING of right view: the speech of another and, inwardly, right reflection’ (cf Majjhima, I, l 1-3; Anguttara, I, p 87, l 32-34; Madhyama, T 26, k 58, p 791a1-2; Ekottara, T 125, k 7, p 578a5-6) Sutras of this kind have dealt with the karanahetu Therefore the six HETUS have been spoken by the Buddha, and, by basing himself on these sutras, the Sthavira [Katyayaniputra] composed this [Jnanaprasthana]-sastra The present passage of the Mahavibhasa will in part be repeated by Samghabhadra in his Nyayanusara, T 1562, k 15, p 416b5-417a9, and by Yasomitra in his Kosavyakhya, p 188, l 13-189, l 13 In Buddhism there are several systems of causality The earliest and best known is that of the twelve- membered conditioned origination (dvadsangapratityasamutpada) in which twelve conditions (pratyaya or nidana) are involved Taught by the Buddha at Benares and many other places, it is universally accepted by all Buddhists Here it is not a question of this system, but of another theory where at first four pratyayas (hetupratyaya, etc,) are involved, to which later six hetus (samprayuktakahetu, etc) were added According to some scholars, the field of action of the four pratyayas coincides exactly with that of the six hetus and the six hetus are equivalent to the four pratyayas; according to others, the action of the pratyayas greatly exceeds that of the hetus This system was not accepted by all the schools, and so its partisans tried to establish its canonicity by showing that the sutras of the Tripitaka dealt with it They claim that the four pratyayas, taken as a group, were spoken in the sutras: this is what is affirmed by the Mahavibhasa in the passage I [Lamotte] have just translated, by the Kosa (II, p 209) and even by the Traite in the pages that follow Unfortunately, despite all the research carried out in the Sutrapitaka, <2167> the passage in question has not been found and, until proof of the contrary, it must be accepted that the early scriptures were still unaware of these four pratyayas In regard to the six hetus, it is useful to establish a distinction among the hetus taken in isolation and the hetus as a group According to some scholars, the group of six hetus appeared early in some sutras that today have disappeared In vain would one look for them in the old texts, but the Sarvastivadin teacher Katyayaniputra was aware of them by the magical power of his pranidhijnana and he mentioned them in his Jnanaprasthana which he compiled three hundred years after the Parinirvana at Tamasavanavihara, a Sarvastivadin monastery of the Cinabhukti district in northwestern India (cf Hiuan-tsang, Si-yu-ki, T 2087, 1785k 4, p 889c) - Without recourse to such a dangerous hypothesis, other scholars frankly recognized that there is no sutra dealing with the six hetus in order and complete The problem is quite different if it is a matter of the six hetus taken in isolation The sutras that allude to such and such a hetu in particular are not missing The Mahavibhasa mentions a certain number of them for us In this sense, the hetus as well as the pratyayas are canonical, but the system that groups together four pratyayas and six hetus is not: it is a theory of the Sarvastivadin-Vaibhasika school Proof of this is that other schools do not recognize it and in turn have proposed other systems: the Sariputrabhidharma has drawn up a list of 10 pratyayas (T 1548, k 25, p 679b5-7); the Theravadin Abhidhamma lists 24 (cf Nyanatiloka, Guide through the Abhidhammpitaka, 1938, p 87-109); Buddhistisches Wörterbuch, 1952, p 145-152) 2 The system in the Abhidharma of the Sarvastivadins The system of the four pratyayas coupled with or completed by that of the six hetus is described in most of the Abhidharmas and Sastras of the Sarvastivadin-Vaibhasika school: Vijnanakaya, T 1539, k 3, p 547b22-c4 (cf Kosa, II, p 299 as note; Prakaranapada, T 1541, k 4, p 645b6-7; T 1542, k 5, p 712b12-13; Jnanaprasthana, T 1543, k 1, p 773a13-14: 774b22-775a9; T 1544, k 1, p 920c5-921a10 Mahavibhasa, T 1545, k 21, p 109a20-28; k 16, p 80a17-22 Abhidharmahrdayasastra of Dharmasri, T 1550, k 1, p 811c1-5, 812a19-25 Transl I Armelin, p 68-69, 72); Samyuktabhidharmasara of Dharmatrata, T 1552, k 2, p 883a3-4; Abhidharmamrtarasa of Ghosaka, T 1553, k 1, p 970a16-b14 (transl J Van den Broeck, p 123-126); Prakaranabhidharmavatara of Skandhila, T 1554, k 2, p 988a21-c24 (transl M van Velthem, p 71-74 Kosa, II, p 244-331; Nyayanusara, T 1562, k 15-20, p 416b-456a The sources mentioned here outline the Sarvastivadin-Vaibhasika concepts on causality: Not only are the samskrtadharmas hetupratyayasamutpanna - which is a tautology - but they depend on a precise number of causes and conditions, namely, the 4 pratyayas and the 6 hetus This does not mean that any dharma indiscriminately is the product of 4 pratyayas: some depend on 4 pratyayas, others on 3, others on 2, but none depend on one single pratyaya And it is the same in regard to the 6 hetus: there is no single unique cause on which the totality of dharmas depends <2168> and this observation excludes the intervention of a Deity unique to the process of causality The play of the 6 hetus is pretty much confused with that of the 4 pratyayas and is only the doublet of them This complicates the task of the exegetists when they treat them conjointly The early masters often limited themselves to speaking of the 4 pratyayas 17863 The system in the Madhyamaka Nagarjuna, author of the Madhyamakasastra, was aware of this system and, in a stanza in his Karika, I, 2 (p 76), he says to his objector: Catvarah pratyaya hetus calambanam anantaram / tathaivadhipateyam ca pratyayo nasti pancamah // There are four conditions: cause, object, antecedent and dominant A fifth condition does not exist From the beginning of his work, Nagarjuna attacks a typically Sarvastivadin position Thus he was connected with this school which, in the first centuries of our era, was widespread in the northwest of India In his Karika, I, 5 (p 81), Nagarjuna rejected outright the four pratyayas: Utpadyate pratityeman itime pratyayah kila / yavan notpadyata ime tavan napratyayah katham // These conditions are at issue when some thing arises in dependence on them; but if nothing arises, how would they not be non-conditions? - In other words, if nothing is conditioned, there can be no question of conditions Going on this evidence, Nagarjuna successively shows the absurdity of the hetupratyaya (Karika, I, 7, p 83), the alambanapratyaya (Karika, I, 8, p 84), the samantarapratyaya (Karika, I, 9, p 85) and the adhipatipratyaya (Karika, I, 10, p 86) We will return to these stanzas later, but already the attitude taken by Nagarjuna in regard to the system of the four conditions is clear: it is a pure and simple rejection If there is a pratityasamutpada, it is characterized by the eight negative characteristics (astavisesanavisista), which are non-cessation (anirodha), non-production (anutpada, etc (cf Madh vrtti, p 3, l 11) and are mingled with emptiness 4 The system in the Great Prajnaparamitasutras If these sutras were to mention the four pratyayas, that would prove their dependence on the Sarvastivada and would throw some light on the origin of an immense literature which, despite its prolixity, carefully conceals its sources On this point we come up against a serious problem of authenticity, for some versions of the Great Sutras pass over the four conditions in silence whereas others that mention them fall into two groups, one group that rejects them and one that accepts them a Versions silent about the four pratyayas 1787The Sanskrit text of the corrected’ Pancavimsatisahasrika and the two earliest Chinese translations of the Pancavimsatisahasrika, that of Dharmaraksa made in 286AD and that of Moksala made in 291AD, say <2169> nothing about the four pratyayas in the place where they should have spoken of them, ie, after the statement of the eighteen sunyatas Pancavimsatisahasrika, ed N Dutt, p 24, l 17 Kouang tsan king, T 222, k 1, p 150a3 Fang kouang pan jo king, T 221, k 1, p 3b1 b Versions rejecting the existence of the four pratyayas They may be found in the collection of the Ta pan jo po lo mi to king, Chinese translation made by Hiuan-tsang between 660 and 663AD: Pancavimsatisahasrika, T 220, book VII, k 402, p 8c11-13: The bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to understand (avaboddhum) that the hetupratyaya, the samanantarapratyaya, the alambanapratyaya and the adhipatipratyaya do not exist (na vidyante) and are not perceived (nopalabhyante) in all dharmas should practice the perfection of wisdom Astadasasahasrika, T 220, book VII, k 479, p 430c7-8: [The bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to understand the sixteen sunyatas] and the alambanasunyata, the adhipatisunyata, the samanantarasunyata (read teng wou kien k’ong), etc, should practice the perfection of wisdom c Versions that adopt the four pratyayas They simply say that the bodhisattva wishing to understand the four pratyayas should practice the perfection of wisdom Pancavimsatisahasrika, Chinese translation by Kumarajiva, T 223, k 1, p 219c12-14 Pancavimsatisahasrika, Tibetan translation, Tib Trip, vol 18, no 731, p 53fol 32b6-7: Sha ra dva tihi bu g€an yan byan chub sems dpah sems dpah chen po dmigs pa dan / dban dan / de ma thag pa dan rgyuhi rken khon du chud par hdod pas ses rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa la bslab par byaho / Sanskrit text of the Satasahasrika, ed P Ghosa, p 80, l 4-6: Punar param Saradvatiputralambanamateyasamantarahetupratyayata avaboddhukamena This wording obviously should be corrected as follows: Punaraparam Saradvatiputra hetusamanantaralambanadhipatipratyayan avaboddhukamena Satasahasrika, Chinese translation by Hiuan-tsang, T 220, book V, k 3, p 13c2-5 - Perhaps the passage on the four pratyayas did not appear in the original version of the Pancavimsati: the adversaries as well as the partisans of this theory could have introduced it into the text, the former in order to reject it, the latter in order to adopt it, at least from the samvrti point of view 5 The system according to the Traite 1788The passage of the Pancavimsatisahasrika which the Traite is about to comment on is placed among the versions that adopt the four pratyayas and are against those that reject them This puts our author in a delicate situation To deny the four pratyayas, as Nagarjuna did in his Madhyamakasastra, is to brush up against nihilism; to accept the four pratyayas, as do the Sarvastivadin Abhidharmikas, is to fall into realism And yet realism and nihilism are the two extreme views condemned by the Buddha (see above, p 2007F) The author of the Traite is going to adopt a middle path which is that of the Prajnaparamita which abstains from taking up (parigrahana) or abandoning (utsarga) <2170> the pratyayas for the good reason that conditioned things are never produced and that, from the beginning, dharmas are parinirvanized (adiparinivrta) Having briefly defined the four pratyayas and the six hetus, the author, worried about objectivity, begins by allowing a Madhyamika objector who considers the conditions to be non-conditions (napratyaya) to speak This objector expresses himself in almost the same way as Nagarjuna in Karikas 7 to 14 of his Pratyayapariksa which is none other than a refutation (nisedha) of the system of the four conditions Then the author explains in detail this system such as the great Sarvastivadin teachers of the Satpadabhidharma and the Vibhasa had conceived it If Nagarjuna pushed negation too far, the Sarvastivadins sinned by excessive realism, and so the author of the Traite tries to bring things back to the point by taking his inspiration from the Prajnaparamita The ordinary person sees the pratyayas and believes them; the wise man also sees the pratyayas but he does not believe them The ordinary person is like the child who sees the moon reflected in the water and tries to grab it; the wise person also sees the moon reflected in the water but he does not seek to grab it because he knows it is not there The dharmas that appear to us as conditioned are empty of reality and like a magical creation The vision that we have of them comes from provisional truth (samvrtisatya); their non-arising and non-cessation is their true nature, which is none other than absence of any nature Pratyaya and Hetu [k 32, p 296b] Sutra (cf Satasahasrika, p 8-0, l 4-6) - The bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to understand the causal condition, the immediately preceding condition, the object condition and the dominant condition of all dharmas should practice the perfection of wisdom (Sarvadharmanam hetusamanantaralambanadhipatyayan avaboddhukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - I THE FOUR CONDITIONS (pratyaya) AND THE SIX CAUSES (hetu) 1789All conditioned dharmas (samskrtadharma) are the result of four conditions (pratyaya): 1) the causal condition (hetupratyaya); 2) the immediately preceding condition (samanantarapratyaya); 3) the object condition (alambanapratyaya); 4) the dominant condition (adhipatipratyaya) 1) The causal condition (hetupratyaya), [is five causes (hetu)]: a the associated cause (samprayuktakahetu), b the simultaneous cause (sahabhuhetu), c the homogeneous cause (sabhagahetu), <2171> d the universal cause (sarvatragahetu), e the ripening cause (vipakahetu)1 These five causes (hetu) are causal condition (hetupratyaya)2 Furthermore, all conditioned dharmas (samskrtadharma) are also called causal condition (hetupratyaya) 2) The immediately preceding condition (samanantarapratyaya) - If one accepts the last mind and the last mental events (caramas cittacaittah), past (atita) as well as present (pratyutpanna), of the arhat [at the moment of nirvana], all the other minds-and-mental-events, past or present, play the role of antecedent [with respect to the minds-and-mental-events that follow them] and are called immediately preceding condition3 3-4) The object condition (alambanapratyaya) is the dominant condition (adhipatipratyaya) - It is all the dharmas4 The bodhisattva who wants to cognize the specific characteristics (svalaksana) and the general characteristics (samanyalaksana) of the four conditions should practice the perfection of wisdom <2172> 1 By vipakahetu we should understand either the cause of ripening (vipakasya hetuh) or the cause which is ripening (vipaka eva hetuh): both interpretations are correct: cf Kosa, II, p 271-272 2 The sixth cause, the karanahetu, which does not present an obstacle to the arising of other dharmas, is not part of the hetupratyaya: cf Kosa II, p 246 3 The flow of the mind is never interrupted except in exceptional cases such as the unconscious absorption (asamjnisamapatti) and the absorption of cessation (nirodhasamapatti) Usually the mind-and-mental-events that arise (utpanna) are the condition as equal (sama) and immediate (anantara) antecedent of the minds-and-mental-events that follow them An exception is made for the last mind and the last mental events of the arhat at the moment of his nirvana: these cannot constitute an immediately preceding condition because no mind and no mental events arise after them (anyacittasambandhanat): cf Mahavibhasa, T 1545, k 10, p 50a22-25; Kosa, II, p 305 4 All dharmas indiscriminately, even if they are not grasped by the consciousness, are capable of being object of this consciousness because its nature remains the same, just as fuel is fuel even when it is not burning - Insofar as it does not present an obstacle to the arising of other dharmas, any dharma is dominant condition of other dharmas, except for itself: cf Kosa, II, p 306-308 1790II OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE EFFICACY OF THE CONDITIONS Objector5 - According to the perfection of wisdom (prajnaparamita), the four conditions (pratyaya) do not exist (nopalabhyante) Why? 1) [Rejection of hetupratyaya] - It is illogical (na yujyate) that the effect (phala) pre-exists in the cause (hetu) and it is also illogical that it does not pre-exist in it6 If the effect pre-existed in the cause, there would not be any cause [since it already exists] If it did not pre-exist in the cause, of what use would this cause be [since it does not occur there]? If it did pre-exist without having pre-existed there, it would also result from a non-cause, by chance (ahetuka) Furthermore, it is necessary to see the effect arise from the cause in order to be able to speak about cause; but if the effect is not there in advance, how can one speak of cause? Furthermore, if the effect arises from a cause (hetor jayate), this effect depends on a cause (hetum apeksate) But this cause is not independent (asvatantra) and in turn, depends on other causes If the cause is not independent, how could one say that the effect depends solely on that cause? <2173> For these many reasons, we know that there is no causal condition (hetupratyaya) 5 This objector is a Madhyamika who is going to reason in a manner very close to that of Nagarjuna in his Madh Karika 6 The objector claims here to be following a version of the Prajnaparamita where the four pratyayas are rejected, whereas the Traite is referring to a version where they are accepted: see above, p 2169F Compare Madh Karika, XX, v 1-4 (p 391-393): Hetos ca pratyayanam ca samagrya jayate yadi / phalam asti ca samagryam samagrya jayate katham // hetos ca pratyayanam ca samagrya jayate yadi / phalam nasti ca samagryam samagrya jayate katham // hetos ca pratyayanam ca samagryam asti cet phalam / grhyeta nanu samagryam samagryam ca na grhyate // hetos ca pratyayanam ca samagryam nasti cet phalam / hetavah pratyayas ca syur ahetupratyayaih samah // Transl - If the fruit that arises from the complex of the cause and conditions already occurs in this complex, why would it need to arise from the complex? If the fruit that arises from the complex of cause and conditions does not occur in this complex, how could it arise from this complex? If the fruit occurred in the complex of cause and conditions, it should certainly be taken hold of in this complex Now it is not held there If the fruit did not occur in the complex of cause and conditions, causes and fruits would be equivalent to non-causes, to non-conditions 17912) [Rejection of the samanantarapratyaya] - Once gone (atita), the minds-and-mental-events (cittacaitasikadharma) are all destroyed (niruddha) and have no further activity (karitra); then how could they constitute an immediately preceding condition (samanantarapratyaya)? The mind presently existing (pratyutpanna) thus has no antecedent7 Perhaps you would like to call upon the future (anagata) to guarantee the [296c] continuity of the mind (cittakrama)? But as this future does not yet exist, how would it assure this continuity? For such reasons, there is no immediately preceding condition (samanantarapratyaya) 3) [Rejection of the object condition] - All [mental] dharmas are without specific characteristic (animitta) and without object (analambana); why then speak of object condition (alambanapratyaya)?8 4) [Rejection of the dominant condition] - All dharmas are equal, being without dependence (anadhina) or support (anasraya); why then speak of dominant condition (adhipratyaya)?9 As these four conditions do not exist, how can the Prajnaparamitasutra say here that in order to understand the four conditions, it is necessary to practice the perfection of wisdom? <2174> III THE OPINION OF THE TRAITE IN REGARD TO CAUSALITY Answer - You do not understand the nature (laksana) of the Prajnaparamita; that is why you claim that, according to the Prajnaparamita, the four conditions (pratyaya) do not exist (nopalabhyante) In view of all dharmas, the Prajnaparamita abandons nothing and refutes nothing (na parityajati na pratisedhayati):10 it is 7 Compare Madh Karika, I, v 9 (p 85): Anupannesu dharmesu nirodho nopapadyate / nanantaram ato yuktam niruddhe pratyayas ca kah // Paraphrase - As long as the dharma-effects have not arisen, the prior cessation of the cause is impossible Assuming that this cessation had taken place, what could be the condition of the effect? Thus the immediately preceding condition is unacceptable 8 Compare Madh Karika, I, v 8 (p 84): Analambana evayam san dharma uoadisyate / athanalambane dharme kuta alambanam punah // Paraphrase - You are teaching that this dharma (= cittacaitta) exists previously without object But if this dharma is fundamentally without object, how could it ever be comprised of one? 9 Madh Karika, I, v 10 (p 86) is expressed differently: Bhavanam nihsvabhavanam na satta vidyate yatah / satidam asmin bhavatity etan naivopapadyate // Paraphrase - Since there is no existence for essences without inherent nature, the sovereignty or predominance of one dharma over another, a dominance expressed by saying: This being, that is, is logically untenable 10 See above, p 2142F, n 1792absolutely pure (atyantaparisuddha) and free of futile proliferation(nisprapanca) According to the word of the Buddha, there are four conditions11 But people with little knowledge (alpavid), being attached to these four conditions (catuspratyayabhinivista), have composed bad treatises (kusastra) on their subject In order to destroy these wrong opinions (abhinivesa), [the Prajnaparamitasutra] teaches the emptiness (sunyata) and indestructibility of dharmas Therefore, arising from a complex of causes and conditions (hetupratyayasamagryutpanna) - namely, the internal and external bases of consciousness (adhyatmabahirdhayatana) - this mind-dharma (cittadharma) is like a magic show (mayopama), deceptive (mrsavada) and without definite nature (niyatasvabhava) And it is the same for the mental-events-dharmas (caitasikadharma) 1 Causality according to the Abhidharma [a The four conditions and the six causes] [As we have just seen, the causal condition (hetupratyaya) is the five causes (hetu): 1) The mental events (caitta) coexist with the mind (cittasahabhu), - namely, feeling (vedana), notion (samjna), intention (cetana), etc12 ; they have the same aspect (ekakara) and the same object (ekalambana) as the mind, being associated’ (samprayukta) with it13 The mind as associated with the mental events is cause, and the mental events as associated with the mind are cause This is what is called associated causes (samprayuktakahetu) These associated causes are like friends and acquaintances who come together to do something <2175> 2) The simultaneous cause (sahabhuhetu) - Conditioned dharmas (samskrtadharma) each have a simultaneous cause and, as simultaneous, these dharmas mutually help each another14 They are like an older brother and a younger brother who, being of the same birth, help one another mutually 3) The homogeneous cause (sabhagahetu) - Dharmas of the good category (kusalanikaya), when they are past (atita), are [homogeneous] cause of present (pratyutpanna) and future (anagata) dharmas; past (atita) or present (pratyutpanna), dharmas of the good category are [homogeneous] cause of future (anagata) 11 The author of the Traite believes, along with the Sarvastivadins, in the existence of a canonical sutra enumerating and listing the four conditions But this sutra has not yet been found in the old scriptures 12 See Kosa, II, p 153-156 13 For Kosa, II, p 267, only the mind and mental events (cittacaitta) that have the same aspect (ekakara), the same object (ekalambana) and the same point of support (samasraya) are samprayuktakahetu 14 Dharmas that are the result of one another (mithahphala) are sahabhuhetu, such as, for example, the great elements (bhuta), the mind (citta) and the accompaniments of the mind (cittanuvartin), that which characterizes (laksana) and that which is characterized (laksya): cf Kosa, II, p 248 1793good dharmas15 [Mutatis mutandis], it is the same for bad (akusala) dharmas and indeterminate (avyakrta) dharmas Thus all dharmas each have their homogeneous cause 4) The universal cause (sarvatragahetu) - The perverse tendencies (anusaya) to be abandoned by seeing the truth of suffering and the truth of the origin (duhkhasamudayasatya-darsanaprahatavya) are cause of all defiled (klista) dharmas and are called universal cause16 <2176> 5) The ripening cause (vipakahetu) - As a result of the accomplishment of action (karman), a favorable (kusala) or unfavorable (akusala) fruit of ripening (vipakaphala) is obtained: this is the ripening cause17 These five causes (hetu) constitute the causal condition (hetupratyaya) 15 Similar (sadrsa) dharmas belonging to one and the same category and to one and the same stage (svanikayabhu) and arisen earlier (agraja), are sabhagahetu Dharmas arisen earlier are homogeneous cause of later dharmas, whether the latter are arisen or not yet arisen (purvotpannah pascimanam utpannanutpannanam sabhagahetuh); future dharmas are never homogeneous cause (anagata naiva sabhagahetuh): cf Kosa, II, p 255-257 - Vasubandhu in his Kosabhasya, p 85, l 24-86, l 2, cites a passage of the Jnanaprasthana, T 1544, k 1, p 920c15-18: Sabhagahetuh katamah purvotpannani kusalamulani pascad utpannanam kusalamulanam tatsamprayuktanam ca dharmanam svadhatau abhagahetuna hetuh evam atitany atitapratyutpannanam atitapratyutpannany anagatanam iti vaktyavyam - What is the homogeneous cause? The previously arisen roots of good are homogeneous cause of roots of good arisen later and of the dharmas associated with them that are of the same category Similarly also, the past roots of good are homogeneous cause of past and present roots of good, and the past and present roots of good are homogeneous cause of future roots of good 16 The anusayas are the perverse tendencies by virtue of which actions are accumulated (upacayam gacchanti) and are capable of producing a new existence (Kosa, V, p 1) Scholasticism lists 98 of them Among them, 11 are called universal (sarvatraga) because they take as object their entire dhatu (sakalasvadhatvalambanatvat), in the sense that they are concerned with all categories of their dhatu in the sphere of existence in which the individual in whom they occur is born (Kosa, V, p 32 at bottom) These 11 universals are: 1-7) the five drstis, satkayadrsti, etc, to be abandoned by the seeing of suffering (duhkhadarsanaprahatavya), plus two drstis, mithyadrsti and silavrataparamarsadrsti, to be abandoned by the seeing of the origin (samudayadarsana-prahatavya); 8-9) the two vicikitsas (doubts concerning the reality of suffering and of non-suffering), to be destroyed by the seeing of suffering and of the origin (duhkhasamudaya-darsanaprahatavya); 10-11) the two kinds of avidya, one associated with the other anusayas, the other alone (aveniki), both of which are to be abandoned by the seeing of suffering and of the origin (cf Kosa, V, p 31; Kosavyakhya, p 458, l 10-16 These universals are sarvatragahetu The Kosavyakhya, p 89, l 3 states: Svabhumikah purvotpannah sarvatraga dharmah pascimanam klistanam dharmanam sarvatragahetuh - The universal dharmas belonging to a certain stage and previously arisen [ie, past or present] are the universal cause of later defiled dharmas 17 According to the simplest interpretation, the vipakahetu is the cause involving ripening Morally defined actions, whether bad (asubha = akusala) or good-impure, produce an unpleasant or a pleasant fruit of ripening respectively, but always morally indeterminate Hence the definition of Kosa, II, p 271: Vipakahetur asubhah kusalas sasravah 1794[Immediately preceding condition (samanantarapratyaya)] - When the minds-and-mental-events (cittacaitta) follow one another in order (kramasas) without intermediary (anantaram), there is the immediately preceding condition18 [Object condition (alambanapratyaya)] - When the minds-and-mental-events (cittachaitta) arise and take things as object (visayan alambya), there is the object condition19 Dominant condition (adhipatipratyaya)] - At the moment of their arising, the dharmas do not obstruct one another mutually: that is an absence of obstacle (avighna) [called dominant condition]20 <2177> [b Number of conditions occurring in the different types of dharmas]21 1) The mind and mental events arise as a result of four conditions (caturbhis cittacaittah) 2) The absorption of non-conception (asamjnisamapatti) and the absorption of cessation (nirodhasamapatti) arise as a result of three conditions [hetupratyaya, samanantarapratyaya, adhipatipratyaya], with the exclusion of the object condition (alamabanapratyaya) 3) The other dharmas, namely, the other formations not associated with the mind (cittaviprayuktasamskara) and the material dharmas (rupa) arise as a result of two conditions [hetupratyaya and adhipatipratyaya], with the exclusion of the immediately preceding condition (samanantarapratyaya) and the object condition (alambanapratyaya) 18 The minds-and-mental-events which immediately precede other minds-and-mental-events are samanantarapratyaya of the latter 19 Every dharma indiscriminately is capable of being taken by the mind and the mental events associated with the latter When a consciousness arises by taking it as object, this dharma is the alambanapratyaya of this consciousness 20 The adhipatipratyaya manifests in such a way that it never presents an obstacle in any circumstance: this is its only activity (Kosabhasya, p 101, l 4-5: adhipatipratyayas tu sarvasyam avasthayam anavaranabhavenavasthita ity etad asya karitram) The cause called raison d’Ītre’ is the dominant condition This dominant condition is the one that belongs to the greatest number of dharmas or that acts on the greatest number of dharmas (Kosabhasya, p 100, l 12- 15: ya eva karanahetuh sa evadhipatipratyayah  adhiko yam pratyayah adhikasya va pratyayah) Every dharma is karanahetu with respect to all dharmas except for itself Every dharma is karanahetu of all conditioned dharmas except for itself insofar as it appears as not being an obstacle to the arising of the others (Kosabhasya, p 82, l 23-24: svato nye karanahetuh samskrtasya hi dharmasya svabhavavarjyah sarvadharmah karanahetuh avighnabhavavasthanat) The author of the Traite, or his translator Kumarajiva, avoids the term karanahetu and substitutes wou tchang yin for it, probably avighnakarana the cause which is not an obstacle’ On the different ways of translating karanahetu, see A Hirakawa, Kosa Index I, p 129, l 14-15 21 Mahavibhasa, T 1545, k 136, p 703a3-b1;

These klesas are defiled (nivrta) whereas the ripening (vipaka) itself is non-defiled (anivrta); therefore the ripening cause should be excluded 3) When they have arisen from retribution (vipaka), form (rupa) and the formations non-associated with the mind (cittaviprayuktasamskara) arise from four causes [karanahetu, sahabhuhetu, sabhagahetu and vipakahetu] Not being mind-and-mental-event (cittacaitta), they exclude the associated cause (samprayuktakahetu); being non-defiled-indeterminate (anitvrtavyakrta), they exclude the universal cause (sarvatragahetu) 4) When they are afflicted (klista), form (rupa) and the formations non-associated with the mind (cittaviprayuktasamskara) also arise from four causes [karanahetu, sahabhuhetu, sabhahahetu and sarvatragahetu] Not being mind-and-mental-event (cittacaitta), they exclude the associated cause (samprayuktahetu); being afflicted (klista), they exclude the ripening cause (vipakahetu) 5) The other minds-and mental-events (sesas cittacaittah), except for the minds pure for the first time (prathamanasrava),25 arise from four causes [karanahetu, sahabhuhetu, sabhagahetu and 22 Kosabhasya, p 101, l 19-20: Pratyayebhyo bhava upajayante na punah sarvasyaiva jagatah isvarapurusapradhanadikam karanam - All the essences arising from four conditions at most and from two at least, the theistic or Samkhya systems that make the world depend on a single condition are to be excluded 23 Abhidharmasara, T 1550, k 1, p 811c1-812a17; Abhidharmamrta, T 1553, k 1, p 970b3-11; Kosa, II, p 297-298; Kosabhasya, p 97, l 14-98, l 2 24 Anivrta-avyakrta (pou yin mou wou ki in Kumarajiva, wou feou wou ki in Hiuan-tsang), which may be rendered as non-defiled-indeterminate’ This is an anivrta mind, not covered by afflictive emotion (na kesacchadita) and avyakrta, indeterminate from the moral point of view, ie, neither good (kusala) nor bad (akusala), and thereby unable to project and bring about a fruit of retribution (phalapratigrahanadanasamartha) The afflictive emotions (klesa) and the dharmas associated with them or deriving their origin from them are called klista, soiled, tainted 25 The prathamanasravas are the first pure dharmas of the Path of seeing the truths, namely, the duhkhe dharmajnanaksanti and the dharmas co-existing with this ksanti See above, p 130F as note, 214F, 651F, 747F, 1412F, 1796F 1796samprayuktakahetu], excluding the ripening cause (vipakahetu) and the universal cause (sarvatragahetu) Why? Not being indeterminate (avyakrta), they exclude the ripening cause (vipakahetu); not being afflicted (klista), they exclude the universal cause (sarvatragahetu) 6) In regard to other things not associated with the mind (anye cittaprayuktadharmah) , namely, form (rupa) and the formations non-associated with the mind (cittaprayuktasamskara), it is necessary to distinguish]: a If they have a homogeneous cause (sabhagahetu), they arise from three causes [karanahetu, sahabhuhetu and sabhagahetu], excluding the associated cause (samprayuktahetu), the ripening cause (vipakahetu) and the universal cause (sarvatragahetu) b If they do not have a homogeneous cause (sabhagahetu), they arise <2179> from two causes: the simultaneous cause (sahabhuhetu) and the cause not making an obstacle’ (avighnakarana) [commonly designated by the name karanahetu] 7) As for form (rupa) and the formations non-associated with the mind (cittaviprayukta-samskara), occurring in minds pure for the first time (prathamanasravacitta), they arise from two causes: the simultaneous cause (sahabhuhetu) and the cause not making an obstacle’ (avighnakarana) There are no dharmas that are derived from one single cause (ekahetusambhuto nasti dharmah)26 The six causes (hetu) make up the four conditions (pratyaya) 2 Causality according to the Perfection of Wisdom The bodhisattva who practices the perfection of wisdom (prajnaparamita) considers the four conditions (pratyaya) , but his mind is not attached to them (sanga); even though he distinguishes (vibhajati) these dharmas, he knows that they are empty (sunya) and like magical transformations (nirmanasama) Although in magical transformations there are many varieties (nanavidhavisesa), the wise man who considers them knows that they have no reality: they are only trompe-l’oeil (caksurvancana), thought-constructions (vikalpa) He knows that the teachings of ordinary people (prthagjanadharma) are all erroneous (viparita), lies (mrsavada), without reality Is there anything real there where there are the four pratyayas? And since the teachings of the saints (bhadraryadharma) are derived from the teachings of ordinary people, they too are unreal As has been said above (p 2142F, 2146F) in regard to the eighteen emptinesses, for a bodhisattva in the perfection of wisdom, there is no determinate nature (niyatasvabava) in any dharma either capable of being 26 Actually the karanahetu and the sahabhuhetu are never absent 1797grasped or capable consequently of being rejected (bhinna) But as beings are attached (sakta) to the emptiness of causes and conditions, they say that they can be rejected27 <2180> Thus, seeing the moon reflected in the water (udakacandra), the little child is greedy for it and is attracted to it; but when he wants to grab it and does not succeed, he feels sad and annoyed The wise man instructs him, saying: This moon can be seen (drsta) with the eyes but it cannot be seized (grhita) with the hand The wise man denies only that it can be seized; he does not claim that it cannot be seen In the same way, the bodhisattva sees and knows that all dharmas arise from the four conditions (pratyaya) but he does not grasp any determinate nature (niyatalaksana) in these conditions Dharmas arising from the complex of the four conditions (catuspratyayasamagrija) are like the moon [297b] reflected in water (udakacandra) Although this moon is false and non-existent (asat), it necessarily arises from causes and conditions - namely, water (udaka) and the moon (candra) - and does not come from other conditions It is the same for dharmas; each one arises from its own causes and conditions and has no fixed reality This is why [the Prajnaparamitasutra] says here that the bodhisattva who wants to understand the causal condition, the immediately preceding condition, the object condition and the dominant condition in accordance with the truth, must practice the perfection of wisdom Question - If one wants to understand completely the meaning of the four conditions (pratyaya), one must study the Abhidharma Why then does [the Prajnaparamitasutra] say here that in order to understand the four conditions, it is necessary to study the Prajnaparamita? Answer - In the explanation dedicated by the Abhidharma to the four conditions, the beginner (adikarmika) believes that it touches realities, but, if he examines them and goes into depth, he falls into wrong views (mithyadrsti) like those that you have formulated above (p 2172F) in rejecting the four conditions28 <2181> 27 The principle of causality is an axiom that is imposed on the human mind, but on reflecting, some take it to be well- founded, others to be purely illusory The writers of the Abhidharma hold it to be valid: they think that that real dharmas arise from real causes and conditions; they seize their characteristics (nimitta) and adopt them (grhnanti): they fall into realism The fundamentalist Madhyamikas, like the one who appears at the beginning of this section, judge concepts of cause and effect to be absurd and reject (nisedhanti) the hetus and pratyayas as non-existent (asat): they are on the brink of nihilism Other Madhyamikas, basing themselves on the true nature of dharmas which is the absence of any nature, abstain from affirming or denying the hetus and pratyayas in which they recognize neither existence nor non-existence This is the position taken by the author of the Traite Slightly less drastic than the preceding, it has the advantage of not laying itself open to any criticism It is the position of an adult explaining to a child that the moon reflected in the water is seen’ when there is a moon and there is water to reflect it, but it cannot be grabbed’ because it is nothing and never will be any thing For the udakacandra, see above, p 364F 28 The author has commented above (p 1095F) that the study of Abhidharma leads to realism, whereas the teaching on emptiness ends up in nihilism The Buddha condemned the extreme views of asti and nasti, of astita and nastita (see p 1798Furthermore, if dharmas, as causes, depend on the four conditions, how are these four conditions caused in turn? If they themselves have causes, there is an infinite regression (anavastha); wherever there is an infinite regression, there is no beginning point (adi); if there is no beginning, there is no cause (hetu) and hence all dharmas would be without cause (ahetuka) If there was a beginning, this beginning would be uncaused and, existing without being caused, it would not depend on causes and conditions That being so, all dharmas themselves would exist without depending on causes and conditions Furthermore, dharmas arising from causes and conditions (hetupratyayasamutpanna) are of two kinds: a If they pre-exist in the causes and conditions, they arise independently of causes and conditions and there is neither cause nor condition for them b If they do not pre-exist in the causes and conditions, they are each without their respective causes and conditions By futile chatter about the four conditions, one comes up against such errors (dosa) But the emptiness consisting of non-perception (anupalambhasunyata) of which it was a matter above (p 2145-2149F) in the Prajnaparamita, does not present such faults Thus, birth, old age, sickness and death (jatijaravyadhimarana) perceived by the eyes and the ears of ordinary people are considered by them to be existent, but, if their characteristics (nimitta) are examined subtly, they are non-existent (anupalabhdha) This is why in the Prajnaparamita, only the wrong views (mithyadrsti) are eliminated, but the four conditions are not rejected This is why it is said here that in order to understand the [real] nature of the four conditions, the perfection of wisdom should be studied Dharmata Second Section UNDERSTANDING DHARMATA AND ITS SYNONYMS PRELIMINARY NOTE The problem of causality was the object of the preceding section: the author came to the conclusion that if this question is asked from the point of view of apparent truth (samvrtisatya), it is to be rejected, or, rather, to be dismissed from the point of view of absolute truth (paramarthasatya) Here he passes on to a connected question which is that of the sarvadharmanam dharmata, the dharma- nature of dharmas’, an expression which Kumarajiva usually translates as tchou-fa-che-siang: the true nature (bhutalaksana) of dharmas (see vol III, Introduction, p xliiF) 2007F), and the Prajnaparamita is the non-grasping (aparigraha) and the non-rejection (anutsarga) of all dharmas (cf Pancavimsati, p 135, l 2) 1799Dharmata often appears in a list of synonyms which has increased over time Contrary to the Tibetans, the Chinese lack consistency in their way of rendering these terms The equivalents <2182> proposed by Kumarajiva are not repeated by Hiuan-tsang, and, on the pain of falling into unfortunate confusion, it is important to distinguish them carefully: 1 dharmata, chos nid, che siang (K), fa eul, fa sing (H) 2 manner of being’, tathata, de bsin nid, jiu (K), tchen jou (K) 3 ’fundamental element’, dharmadhatu, chos kyi dbyins, fa sing (K), fa kiai (H) 4 limit of truth’, bhutakoti, yag dag pahi mthah, che tsi (K), che tsi (H) The passage of the Pancavimsati commented on here by the Traite is limited to these four terms, but other lists, more complete, have already been proposed by the earliest canonical texts: Samyutta, II, p 25, l 19-20: dhatu, dhammatthitata, dhammaniyamata, idappaccayata Samyutta, II, p 26, l 5-6: tathata, avitathata, anannathata, idappaccayata Nidanasamyukta, p 148: dharmata, dharmasthitaye dhatuh Ibid, p 149: dharmata, dharmasthitata, dharmaniyamata, dharmayathatatha, avitathata, ananyatha, bhuta, satyata, tattvaa, thatathata, aviparitata, aviparyastata, idampratyata, pratityasamutpadanulomata Ibid, p 164: dharmata, dharmasthitaye dhatuh Anguttara, I, p 286, l 7-8: dhatu, dhammatthitata, dhammaniyamata Sanskrit Mahaparinirvana, p 168: dharmata, dharmasthitaye dhatuh Salistamba, ed Sastri, p 4, l 5-7: dharmata, dharmasthitita, dharmaniyamata, pratityasamutpadasamata, tathata, aviparitathata, ananyatathata, bhutata, satyata, aviparitata, aviparyastata Sutra cited in Kosavyakhya, p 293, l 27-28: dharmata, dharmasthitita, dharmaniyamata, tathata, avitathata, ananyatathata, bhutata, satyata tattvam, aviparitata, aviparyastata The word bhutakoti does not appear in our nomenclatures What is this dharmata the many synonyms of which emphasize its importance rather than its complexity? Buddhist practitioners conceive of it differently according to whether they belong to the Lesser or the Greater Vehicle 1 The Hinayanist dharmata According to the word of the Buddha himself, dharmata is the conditioned production of phenomena, the pratityasamutpada discovered by Sakyamuni and preached by him throughout his entire career 1800Two sutras of the Samyukta are significant: Nidanasamyukta, p 147-148; Samyutta, II, p 25-26: Pratityasamutpadam vo bhiksavo desayisye  / pratityasamutpadah katamah / yadutasmin satidam bhavaty asyotpadad idam utpadyate / yadutavidyapratyayah samskara yavat <2183> samudayo bhavati / avidyapratyayah samskara ity utpadad va tathagatanam anutpadad va sthita eveyam dharmata dharmasthitaye dhatuh /- I will show you, O monks, the dependent origination What is dependent origination? The fact that this being, that is; from the production of this, that is produced’, namely, that the formations have ignorance as condition’, etc, up to such is the origin of the mass of suffering’ Whether a Tathagata appears or whether a Tathagata does not appear, this dharmata, the basis for the existence of things, is stable Nidanasamyukta, p 164: Kin nu Bhagavata pratityasamutpadah krta aho svid anyaih / na bhikso maya pratityasamutpadah krto napy anyaih / api tutpadad va tathagatanam anutpadad va sthita eveyam dharmata dharmasthitaye dhatuh / - Was dependent origination made by the Lord or rather by others? Dependent origination, O monks, was not made by me or by others, and, whether there appears a Tathagata or there does not appear a Tathagata, this dharmata, the basis for the existence of things, is stable These two texts do not lend themselves to any confusion Conditioned dharmas (samskara, samskrtadhrma) are, by definition, the result of causes and conditions Their dependent production (pratityasamutpada) is a fixed rule, a stable dharmata, and the latter has not been made either by the Buddha or by any one else The question is whether this dharmata leads to an abstract determinism or whether it constitutes an independent entity, in other words, whether it should be placed among the samskrta endowed with the three characteristics of the conditioned (samskrtalaksana), viz, production (utpada), disappearance (vyaya) and duration-change (sthityanyathatva) - cf p 36-37F, 922F, 1163F, 2051F, 2078F - or among the asamskrtas completely free of these very characteristics The Hinayana schools respond differently to this question for the good reason that they do not agree on the number of asamskrtas: one, three, four, five or even nine (see references to these schools in L de La Vallee Poussin, Nirvana, p 180-187) The Vaibhasikas of the Madhyadesa, the Uttarapathakas, the Mahimsasakas, the Pubbaseliyas, the Mahisasakas and the Mahasamghikas include the praityasamutpada or its synonym, tathata, among their asamskrtas This is not the opinion of the Ceylonese Theravadins, the ones closest to the Word of the Buddha, who recognize only one asamkhata, Nibbana The paticcasamuppada is a rule and not an entity Their spokesman, Buddhaghosa, comments in his Visuddhimagga (ed H C Warren, p 441): Jarasaranadinam dhammanam paccayakkhano paticcasamuppado, dukkhanubandhanaraso, kummaggapaccupattano ti veditabbo So panayam tehi tehi paccayehi anonadhikeh’ eva tassa tassa dhammassa sambhavato tathata ti, samaggiupagatesu paccayesu muhuttam pi tato nibbattanadhammanam 1801asambhavabhavato avitathata ti, annadhammapaccayehi annadhammanuppattito anannathata ti, yathavuttanam etesam jaramaranadinam paccayato va paccayasamuhato va idapaccayata ti vitto - Conditioned origination has, as nature, being the condition of the dharmas old-age-death, etc; as flavor, it has the prolongation of suffering; it shows itself as the bad path (= samsara) Because such and such a dharma comes only from a definite number of such and such conditions, <2184> it is called tathata Because once these conditions have come together, it is impossible, even for an instant, for the dharmas that are derived from it to be produced, it is called avitathata Because dharmas do not arise from other conditions than their own, it is called anannathata Because for the old-age-death in question, there is one condition or a group of conditions, it is called idapaccayata The Sarvastivadins assume three asamskrtas: Space (akasa) and the two Nirvanas (pratisamkhyanirodha and apratisamkhyanirodha), but they do not consider pratityasamutpada to be an asamskrta, for everything that is production’ (utpada) is obviously conditioned Vasubandhu (Kosa, II, p 77) makes the following comment about the Hinyana schools that place the pratityasamutpada with the asamskrtas: Some schools (nikayantariya) maintain that the pratityasamutpada is unconditioned (asamskrta) because the sutra says: Whether a Tathagata appears or whether a Tathagata does not appear, this dharmata is stable’ - This thesis is true or false according to the way it is interpreted (tad etadabhiprayavasad evam ca na caivam) If one means that it is always as a result of avidya, etc, that the samskaras, etc, are produced, not without condition or because of another thing’ (apraityanayad va pratitya); that, in this sense, the pratityasamutpada is eternal (nitya), we agree If one means that there exists a certain special entity (kimcid bhavanantaram) called pratityasamutpada which is eternal, that is unacceptable since production (utpada) is characteristic of the conditioned (utpadasya samskrtalaksana) - Indeed, it is absurd to claim that a conditioned origination is eternal, for production means existence following upon non-existence’ (abhutyabhava) 2 The Mahayanist dharmata The reasoning of the Mahayanists is not lacking in subtlety It can be schematized in the following way: 1 For the Early ones, the true nature of conditioned dharmas (samskrta) is to come from conditions (pratityasamutpanna) According to them, dharmata = pratityasamutpada 2 For us, dharmas coming from conditions do not exist in themselves, do not exist by themselves, are without characteristics (laksana) and consequently do not arise For us, pratityasamutpada = anutpada 3 To attribute a characteristic of non-arising to dharmas is to make them into unconditioned Anutpanna = asamskrta 4 To attribute to the unconditioned any characteristic whatsoever is to change them into conditioned dharmas Therefore asamskrta = Samskrta 18025 Backing away from this absurd conclusion, it is necessary to recognize that dharmas are neither samskrta nor asamskrta (cf above, p 2077-2085F, Sunyatas no 7 and 8), neither pratityasamutpanna nor apratityasamutpanna, and that their dharmata is not absolute but contingent Whether it is called dharmata, tathata, dharmadhatu, bhutakoti, sunyata, original nirvana, it has as unique nature the absence of nature: ekalaksana yadutalaksana <2185> (cf Pancavimsati, p 164, 225, 244, 258, 261, 262 and above, p 1376F, 1382F, 1694F, 1703F, etc) While keeping the early phraseology and the early classifications, the Mahayana sutras and sastras refuse to adopt the objectifying of the dharmata Here are a few citations chosen from many others: 1 Pancavimsati, p 168, l 11-17; Satasahasrika, p 1262, l 1-3, 13-17: Katame Bhagavan samskrta dharmah / bhagavan aha / kamadhatu rupadhatur arupyadhatur ye py anye kecit traidatukaparyapanna dharmah / saptatrimsad bodhipaksadayo dharmah / ima ucyante samskrta dharmah // katame bhagavann asamskrta dharmah / bhagavan aha / yesam dharmanam notpado na nirodho nanyathatvam prajnayate ragaksayo dvesaksayo mohaksayas ca / tathata, avitathata, ananyatathata, dharmata, dharmadhatur, dharmasthita, dharmaniyamata, bhutakotih / ima ucyante samskrta dharmah / Which, O Lord, are the conditioned dharmas? The Lord answered: The realm of desire, the form realm, the formless realm (ie, the threefold world where samsara takes place) and also some other dharmas included in the conditioned element, for example, the thirty-seven auxiliaries of enlightenment: they are called conditioned dharmas - Which, O Lord, are the unconditioned dharmas? The dharmas where neither production nor disappearance nor change occur (that is, free from the three natures of the conditioned); the cessation of desire, the cessation of hatred, the cessation of delusion (otherwise called: nirvana); the way of being and its synonyms up to and including the culmination of truth: all that is called unconditioned dharmas All these dharmas arbitrarily classed as samskrta and asamskrta are without inherent nature (svabhava) and have non-existence as their own nature: Pancavimsati, p 136-137: Rupam virahitam rupasvabhavena yavad bhutakotir api virahita bhutakotisvabhavena  / abhavo rupasya svabhavah yavad abhavo bhutakotyah svabhavah - Form is without the inherent nature of form and so on, up to: the culmination of the real is without the inherent nature of the culmination of the real  The inherent nature of form is a non-existence, and so on up to: the inherent nature of the culmination of the real is a non-existence 2 The dharmata of dharmas is emptiness, the non-existence of all dharmas Dasabhumika, p 65, l 19-22: Api tu khalu punah kulaputraisa sarvadharmanam dharmata / utpadad va tathagatanam anutpadad va sthitaivasa dharmata dharmadhatusthitih / ya idam sarvadharmasunyata sarvadharmanupalabdhih - Furthermore, O sons of good family, here is what this dharmata of all dharmas is: Whether there is appearance of a Tatha„ata or whether there is non- appearance of a Tathagata, this dharmata is stable, this steadiness of the fundamental element, namely, the emptiness of all dharmas, the non-existence of all dharmas 18033 Because of this emptiness, of this non-existence, all dharmas are equal: samskrta and asamskrta are one and the same The dharmata is the equality of all things: Astadasa, II, p 126: Sa punah sarvadharmanam samata katama / bhagavan aha / tathata avitathata ananyatathata dharmata dharmadhatur dharmasthitita dharmaniyamata bhutakotih / yo sav utpadad va tathagatanam  4 The pratityasamutpada which the Early ones held to be real and termed <2186> dharmata, the Madhyamikas call emptiness, nirvana This nirvana, which is one with samsara, is empty of nirvana - See above, p 2015-2018F In the Madhyamaka philosophy, there is so little room for the Absolute that it can be neither affirmed nor denied To qualify it as anirvacaniya does not mean that it is ineffable’, but simply that there is no reason to speak of it Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 24, l 18-21; Satasahasrika, p 81, l 1-11) - Moreover, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to understand the manner of being of all dharmas, the fundamental element, the pinnacle of the truth, must practice the perfection of wisdom This is how, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva should become established in the perfection of wisdom (Punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvena mahasattvena sarvadharmatathatam bhutakotim avaboddhukamena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam Evam Sariputra bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam sthatavyam) Sastra - I TATHATA, DHARMADHATU AND BHUTAKOTI29 29 Among the many synonyms of dharmata, the sutra mentions here only three, of which the third, the bhutakoti, did not appear in the Hinayana phraseology In the Vijnanavadin treatises, which place the dharmata among the asamskrtas, there are more explanations, more concise than those of the Traite Madhyantavibhagabhasya, ed G M Nagao, p 23-24: Ananyatharthena tathata nityan tathaiveti krtva / aviparyasarthena bhutakotih viparyasavastutvat / nimittanirodharthenanimittam sarvanimittabhavat / aryajnanagocaratvat paramarthah / paramajnanavisayatvad aryadharmahetutvad dharmadhatuh / aryadharmanam tadalambanaprabhavatvat / hetvartho hy atra dhatvarthah / - [Sunyata] is tathata because, unchanging, it dwells always the same It is bhutakoti because, without error, it is free of error It is animitta because, destroying the characteristic marks, it is the absence of any mark It is paramartha because it is the domain of the saint’s knowledge It is dharmadhatu because it is the object of supreme knowledge and the cause of the dharmas of the saint inasmuch as it is the support and the place of origin of the dharmas of the saint: here dhatu has the meaning of cause See also Abhidharmasamuccaya, ed P Pradhan, p 12, l 20-13, l 5 (transl W Rahula, p 18-19); Abhidharmasamuccayavyakhya, T 1606, k 2, p 702b4-22; Buddhabhumi, T 1530, k 7, p 323a25-29 - Note that these Vijnanavadin texts recognize a reality in the dharmata which the Madhyamaka categorically rejects 18041) The Tathata manner of being’ of all dharmas is of two kinds: i) the specific nature (svalaksana) belonging to each dharma; ii) the dharmata true nature’ The specific nature belonging to each dharma is, for example, the solidity (khakkhatatva) of earth (prthivi), the wetness (dravatva) of water (ap-), the warmth of fire (usnatva) of fire (tejas), the mobility (iranatva) <2187> of wind (vayu): such natures differentiate dharmas, each of which has its own nature The dharmata distinguishes and postulates, in these specific natures, an ungraspable (anupalabdha), indestructible (abhedya) reality (tattva) free of defects (nirdosa) See (p 2121-2126F) what has been said in regard to the emptiness of specific characteristics (svalaksanasunyata) Indeed, if earth (prthivi) is really solid, how can it be that glue (gavyadrdha)30, etc, when brought near the fire, loses [this solidity] which is its [297c] intriinsic nature (svabhava)? How can it be that the man endowed with the superknowledge of the working of magic (rddhyabhijna) sinks into the earth as if it were water? How does it happen that by cutting and breaking up wood (kastha) or stone (sila), they lose their solidity? And how can it be that by reducing earth into fine dust (rajas) and hitting the latter with a stick, the earth finally disappears into the void (sunya) and loses its nature of solidity? Examined in this way, the inherent nature of earth is non-existent (anupalabdha) But that which is non-existent is truly empty (sunya) Therefore emptiness is the true nature (bhutalaksana) of earth And it is the same for all [so-called] specific natures (bhinnalaksana) This emptiness is called tathata 2) The dharmadhatu - As I have said above (p 2126F and following), dharmas taken individually (prthak, pratyekam) are empty These emptinesses have their own respective modalities (visesa) which are, however, tathata Together they form a single emptiness: the dharmadhatu This dharmadhatu itself is also of two kinds: the first, with a mind free of attachment (nirasangacittena), distinguishes (paricchinatti) dharmas as each having its own nature (svabhava, prakrti); the second is the immense dharma (apramanadharma), ie, the true nature of dharmas (dharmanam bhutalaksanam or dharmata) [Visesacintibrahmapariprccha]31 - As has been said in the Tch’e-sin king (Visesacintasutra): The dharmadhatu is immense The sravakas attain the dharmadhatu, but since their wisdom (prajna) is limited (sapramana), they cannot speak of its <2188> immensity (apramanam)32 In the case of the dharmadhatu, they are like the man who 30 Example already used above, p 1821F, 2232F 31 T 586, k 2, p 43b12 - Above (p 1848-1852F), the Traite cited a long extract from this Pariprccha, where Sariputra and the bodhisattva Samantapuspa exchanged views on the dharmadhatu For the Chinese and Tibetan versions of this work, see p 1268, note) 32 In the Saddharmapunḍarika, p 60, l 8-10, Sariputra, the most famed of the sravakas, having heard the first exposition of the Lotus, made the following comment to the Buddha: Tulye nama dharmadhatupravese (in Tibetan: chos kyi dbyins la hjug pa mtshuns na) vayam bhagavata hinena yanena niryatitah / evam ca me bhagavatams tasmin samaye bhavaty asmakam evaiso paradho naiva bhagavato paradhah /- In an equal introduction to the dharmadhatu [ie, by introducing all of us alike - bodhisattvas and sravakas - into the dharmadhatu], Bhagavat has made us go by 1805goes to the great ocean (mahasamudra) to empty out the water but who uses a vessel (bhajana) so small that he cannot collect the immense waters 3) The bhutakoti - Because the dharmadhatu is actually proven (bhutena saksatkrta), it is the culmination (koti) [of reality] Thus the saint (arhat) is established in the culmination of reality (bhutakotyam vyavasthitah)33 II SYNONYMITY OF THE THREE WORDS Question - Tathata, dharmadhatu and bhutakoti: these three things are identical (ekartha) or different (nanartha) If they are the same, why use three words? If they are three different things, it would be fitting to distinguish them now Answer - The three words are synonyms (paryaya) serving to designate the dharmata Why is that? Ignorant worldly people (prthagjana) have wrong views (mithyadarsana) of all the dharmas and speak of permanent (nitya), happy (sukha), pure (suci), real (bhuta) and personal (atmaka) dharmas34 The disciples (sravaka) of the Buddha consider things according to their principal characteristics (maulalaksana) Then, not seeing any permanent dharmas, they speak of impermanence (anityata); <2189> not seeing any happy dharmas, they speak about suffering (duhkha); not seeing any pure dharmas, they speak about impurity (asuci); not seeing any real dharmas, they speak about emptiness (sunyata), and not seeing any personal dharmas, they speak about non-self (anatman) But, while not seeing permanent dharmas, seeing impermanence (anityata) is a wrong view (mithyadrsti)35 And it is the same for the views of suffering, emptiness, non-self and impurity That is what is called tathata the Lower Vehicle And so this thought has presented itself to me: it is, without a doubt, our [the sravakas’] fault, not the Bhagavat’s - For this interpretation, see E Burnouf, Lotus, p 39, 361 The indivisibility (aprabheda) of the dharmadhatu has the single Vehicle as its corollary Question in regard to the single Vehicle has been treated exhaustively by L Hurvitz in One Vehicle or Three?, transl into English by L Hurvitz , Jour Ind Phil, 3 (1975), p 79-166 33 Allusion to the canonical saying: Tinno paramgato thale titthati brahmano: Having crossed over and attained the other shore, the brahmana is on solid ground (Anguttara, II, p 5-6; IV, p 11-13; Samyutta, IV, p 157, 174-175; Itivuttaka, p 57) In this saying, brahmana means arahata, and paramgata is synonymous with kotigata (cf Mahaniddesa, I, p 20) 34 Worldly people fall into the four mistakes (viparyasa), particularly the wrong view of eternalism (sasvatadrsti) 35 The sravakas fall into the wrong view of annihilation (ucchedadrsti), for it is one thing to determine that all dharmas are impermanent and another thing to hypostatize this impermanence (anityata) Eternalism and nihilism have both been condemned by the Buddha (cf p 155F, etc) 1806The tathata is fundamentally indestructible (avinasin); this is why, [in the Chandasutra of the Samyuktagama] the Buddha enunciated the three rules constituting the three Seals of the Dharma (dharmamudra), namely: i) All conditioned dharmas are impermanent (sarvasamskara anityah); ii) All dharmas are non-self (sarvadharma anatmanah); iii) Nirvana is peace (santam nirvanam)36 Question - But these three Seals of the Dharma are completely broken (upaghata) by the Prajnaparamita[sutra] where the Buddha says to Subhuti: The bodhisattva-mahasattva who considers form (rupa) to be permanent (nitya) is not practicing the perfection of wisdom; the bodhisattva-mahasattva who considers form to be impermanent (anitya) is not practicing the perfection of wisdom And it is the same if he considers it as happy (sukha) or unhappy (duhkha), self (atman) or non-self (anatman), peaceful (santa) or non-peaceful (asanta)37 That being so, why speak of the Seals of the Dharma? Answer - The two sutras [touched on here, namely, the Chandasutra and the Prajnaparamitasutra] are both the Word of the Buddha (buddhavacana), but it is in the Prajnaparamitasutra that the Buddha spoke most clearly about the true nature of dharmas (dharmata or bhutalaksana) <2190>[298a] There are people who, being attached to the error of permanence (nityam iti viparyase bhinivista), reject this eternalist view (sasvatadrsti) but are not, however, attached to impermanence (anityata): this is the true Seal of the Dharma (dharmamuda) The fact of rejecting eternalism (sasvata) and [in turn] adopting impermanence (anityata) should not be considered as a Seal of the Dharma It is the same in regard to the view of self (atmadrsti) and the other views up to that of peace (santadrsti) In the Prajnaparamita, [the Buddha] condemns attachment (abhinivesa) to the wrong views of impermanence, etc, (anityadrsti), but does not condemn the fact of accepting nothing (aparigraha), of adopting nothing (anabhinivesa)38 Having acquired this tathata of dharmas, one penetrates into the dharmadhatu, one eliminates all opinions (vipasyana) and does not conceive any further beliefs, for such is its essence (prakrtir asyaisa)39 Thus, when a small child (balaka) sees the moon reflected in the water (udakacandra), he goes into the water to grab the moon but, unable to grab it, he is very sad A wise person then tells him: Such is its essence; so don’t be sad (daurmanasya) 36 Chandasutra of the Samyukta (T 99,no 262, k 10, p 66b14), having as correspondent the Pali Channasuttanta of the Samyutta, III, p 132, l 26-27 In the former, the Buddha states: Sarve samskara anityah, sarve dharma anatmanah, santam nirvanam; in the latter: Sabbe sankhara anicca, sabbe dhamma anatta These are the seals of the Dharma (dharmamudra): cf p 1369F 37 For the idea, cf Pancavimsati, p 131 and foll, Satasahasrika, p 568 and foll: Bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam carata rupam anityam iti  rupam duhkham iti  rupam anatmeti  rupam santam iti na sthatavya Similarly for the other skandhas 38 Cf Pancavimsati, p 135, l 2: Yah sarvadharmanam aparigraho nitsargah sa prajnaparamita - The fact of not accepting and not rejecting any dharma is the perfection of wisdom 39 Prakrtir asyaisa is a frequent refrain in Mahayana explanations: cf p 2031-2035F (definition of the 16 emptinesses), 2112F (in the Samrddhisutra), 2114F note 1807Finally, to completely penetrate (supravidh-) the dharmadhatu is bhutakoti III TATHATA, DHARMADHATU AND BHUTAKOTI IN THE CANONCIAL SUTRAS Question - In the system of the sravakas, why do they not speak of the tathata, dharmadhatu and bhutakoti, whereas they are often spoken of in many places in the Mahayana system? Answer - There are some places in the system of the sravakas where they are also spoken of, but these places are rather rare 1) [Bhiksusutra]40 - Thus it is said in the Tsa-a-han (Samyuktagama): <2191> There was a certain bhiksu who questioned the Buddha: Was the twelve-membered dependent origination (dvadasangapraityapsamutpada) made by the Buddha or was it made by others? The Buddha said to the bhiksu: I myself did not make the twelve-membered dependent origination and it was not made by others Whether there are Buddhas or whether there are no Buddhas, the manner of being of the dharmas (dharmanam tathata), the dharma nature (dharmata), the stability of dharmas (dharmasthitita), is eternal That is to say: this being, that is (yad utasmin satidam bhavati), by the production of this, that is produced (asyotpadad idam utpadyte) That is to say: the formations have ignorance as condition (yad idam avidyapratyayah samskarah), consciousness has the formations as condition (samskarapratyayam vijnanam), and so on up to old-age-and-death (jaramarana) which is followed by grief (soka), lamentation (parideva), suffering (duhkha), sadness (daurmanasya) and torment (upayasa)41 40 This sutra, the original Sanskrit of which we now possess but which has no exact correspondent in the Pali Nikaya, has already been called upon by the Traite, p 157F n It is the Bhiksusutra of the Samyuktagama (T 99, no 299, k 12, p 85b-c, Nidanasamyukta, p 164-165: Anyataro bhiksur yena bhagavams  samskara yavat samudayo nirodhas ca bhavati / Transl - A certain monk went to where the Blessed one was Having gone there and having bowed down to the feet of the Blessed one, he said to the Blessed One: Was dependent origination made by the Blessed One or by others? O monk, dependent origination was not made by me or by others However, whether a Tathagata appears or does not appear, stable is this dharmata, the foundation for the existence of things The Tathagata himself, having recognized and fully understood this [dependent origination], enunciates it, makes it known, establishes it, analyzes it, reveals it, preaches it, teaches and illuminates it Namely: This being, that is; from the production of this that is produced: Formations have as condition ignorance, and so on up to: Such is the origin and the cessation [of this great mass of suffering] 41 Note that sokaparidevaduhkhadauramanasya is not one of the angas of the twelvefold chain 1808This not being, that is not (asminn asatidam na bhavati); by the cessation of this, that ceases (asya nirodhad idam nirudhyate) That is to say: the cessation of ignorance results in the cessation of the formations (yad utavidyanirodhat samskaranirodhah), by the <2192> cessation of the formations consciousness ceases (samskaranirodhad vijnananirodhah), and so on up to the cessation of old-age-and- death (jaramarana), by means of which grief (soka), lamentation (parideva), suffering (duhkha), sadness (daurmanasya) and torment (upayasa) cease - This law of production and cessation (utpadanirodhadharma), whether there is a Buddha or there is not a Buddha, is eternal This is the place where it is a question of the tathata)42 2) [Sariputrasimhanadasutra]43 - In the Tsa-a-han (Samyuktagama), in the Chö-li-fou che-tseu heou king (Sariputrasimhanadasutra), it is said: The Buddha questioned Sariputra about the meaning of a verse (padartha) Three times he asked him and three times Sariputra was unable to answer After the Buddha had given Sariputra a brief instruction (alpanirdesa), the Buddha went back to the vihara to meditate44 <2193> 42 The Bhiksusutra us not the only canonical sutra where tathata occurs The author could have mentioned the Paccayasuttanta of the Samyutta, II, p 26, l 5 43 The Traite has referred three times already (p 220-221F; 1630F n 2; 1746F) to this sutra, all versions of which have been identified by EWaldschmidt, Identifizierung einer Handscrift des Nidanasamyukta, ZDMG, 107 (957), p 380- 381: 1) Nidanasamyukta, p 198-204 The scene takes place in Rajagrha; the sutra does not have a title, but here the Traite designates it under the name of Sariputrasimhanadasutra Sutra of the Lion’s Roar of Sariputra 2) Samyuktagama, sutra 345, T 99, k 14, p 95b10-95c16 This is the Chinese version of the preceding 3) Samyutta, II, p 47-50 Sutta taking place at Savatthi and entitled Bhutam in the same text (Samyutta, II, p 47, l 8), Bhutam idam in the Uddanas (ibid, p 67, l 29) 4) Samyutta, II, p 54-56, sections III and IV of the Kaḷarasutta located at Savatthi - The Sanskrit-Chinese and Pali versions show many divergences C Tripathi has mentioned and discussed them in his remarkable edition of the Nidanasamyukta, p 198-204 44 Nidanasamyutta, p 198-203: Tatra bhagavan ayusmantam sariputram amantrayati / uktam idam sariputra maya parayanesv ajitaprasnesu / ye ca sankhyatadharmani ye ca saiksah prthagvidhah / tesam me nipakasyeryam prstah prabruhi marisa // ke sariputra saiksah ke ca sankhyatadharmani / Evam ukta ayusman sariputras tusni / dvir api trir api bhagavan ayusmantam sariputra, idam avocat / dvir api trir apy ayusman saripitras tusnim abhut / Evam etad bhutam [idam] bhadanta  / yad bhutam tan nirodhadharmam iti viditva nirodhadharmasya bhiksur nirvide viragaya nirodhaya paripanno bhavati / ima ucyante saikshah  yad bhutam tan nirodhadharmam iti viditva 1809 nirodhadharmasya bhiksur nirvide viragaya nirodhayanupadayasravebhyah suvimuktacitto bhavati / ima ucyante sankhyatadhrmaanah / Evam etac sariputra /  Atha bhagavan utthayasanad viharam pravisat pratisamlayanaya // Transl - Then the Bhagavat said to the venerable Sariputra: Sariputra, it was said by me, in the Questions of Ajita, to the Parayana: Some have assessed things (sankhyatadharman) well; others - and they are diverse - are still practicing (saiksa) Tell me, O friend, I the Sage am asking you, what is their behavior? Who are those who are still practicing and who are those who have assessed things well? Thus questioned, Sariputra remained silent A second and a third time, the Bhagavat asked the same question; a second and a third time Sariputra remained silent Then the Bhagavat said to the venerable Sariputra: This arising  - This is how it is, Lord This arises Knowing that what arises is destined to perish, a certain bhiksu is directed to disgust, renunciation, cessation of that which is destined to perish: bhiksus [like that] are called saiksa - Knowing that what has arisen is destined to perish certain bhiksus, out of disgust, renunciation, cessation of that which was destined to perish, have their minds completely liberated from impurities: bhiksus [like that] are called sankhyatadharman - That is so, O Sariputra Then the Bhagavat arose from his seat and went back to the vihara to meditate The stanza ye ca sankhyatadharmani occurs in the Ajitamanavapuccha of the Parayanavagga of the Suttanipata, stanza 1038; it is cited in the Nettippakarana, p 17, and the Jatakas, IV, p 266: Ye ca samkhatadhammase ye ca sekha puthu idha / teasm me nipako iriyam puttho pabruhi marisa // It establishes a distinction between the saiksas disciples who are still practicing’ (siksa silam esam iti saiksah, according to Panini, IV, 4, 62) and the sankhyatadharmans, ie, the arhats or asaiksas who no longer practice’ Three times the Buddha questions Sariputra as to how they differ, and three times Sariputra is silent We are reduced to three hypotheses for the reasons for this silence (see those of Buddhaghosa in his Commentary on the Samyutta, II, p 60, l 16-61, l 2; W Geiger, Samyutta-Nikaya, II, p 69, n) The Buddha prompts his great disciple with two words: Butam idam Sariputra repeats them and continues: Bhutam idam, yad bhutam tan nirodhadharmam This arises, and what arises is destined to perish This is an old canonical saying (cf Majjhima, I, p 260, l 9, 14, 20, 25), often formulated as follows: Yam kinci samudayadhammam sabbam tam nirodhadhammam All that is destined to arise is destined to perish (cf Vinaya, I, p 11, 16, 19, 23, 37, 40, 181, 226; II, p 157, 192; Digha, I, p 110, 148; II, p 41, 43-44; Majjhima, I, p 380, 501; II, p 145; III, p 280; Samyutta, IV, p 47, 192; V, p 423; Anguttara, IV, p 186, 210; Udana, p 49 This saying condenses the doctrine of the pratityasamutpada into a few words And it is indeed the pratityasamutpada we are dealing with here, for the difference between the saiksas and the sankhyatadharmans (= asaiksas) consists in the fact that the former must still penetrate this fundamental truth (dharmata, tathata, dharmadatu, etc) whereas the latter have so complete an understanding of it that their impurities (asrava) have been destroyed and their task is fulfilled 1810Then Sariputra rejoined the bhiksus and said to them: As long as the Buddha did not give me his approval (abhanumodana), I <2194> did not reply But now, for seven days and seven nights without stopping, I myself would be able to furnish him with explanations on that subject45 Then a certain bhiksu said to the Buddha: After the Buddha had returned to the vihara to meditate, Sariputra uttered the lion’s roar and boasted The Buddha said to the bhiksu: What Sariputra said is true and not false Why? Because Sariputra has penetrated well the dharmadhatu (tatha hi sariputrasya bhiksor dharmadhatuh suptratividdhah)46 <2195> This is what Sariputra has just explained here, and the Buddha congratulates him for his answer 45 Nidanasamyukta, p 202-203: Athhayusman Sariputro ciraprakarantam bhagavantam viditva bhiksun amantrayati / apratisamviditam mam ayusmanto bhagavan etam prathamam prasnam prstavan / tasya me bhud apurvam dhandhayitatvam / yatas ca me bhagavams tat prathamam prasnavyakaranam abhyanumoditavan tasya me etad abhavat / sacet kevalikam ratrim bhagavan etam evartham anyaih padair anyair vyanjanaih prasnam prcchet kevalikam apy aham ratrim bhagavata etam evartham padair anyair vyanjanaih prasnam prsto vyakuryam / saced ekam divasam/ ekam ratridivasam/ saptapi ratridivasani Bhagavan mam etam evartham anyaih padair anyair vyanjanaih prasnam prsto vyakudivasani bhagavata etam evartham anyaih padair anyair vyanjanaih prasnam prsto vyakuryam / Transl - Then, seeing that the Bhagavat had gone, Sariputra said to the bhiksus: While I did not yet know what he meant, O venerable ones, I felt more embarrassed than I have ever felt before But as soon as the Bhagavat had approved of my first answer to his question, I had the following thought: If the Bhagavat questioned me on the same subject for a night using different phrases and different words, I would, for this whole night, be able to answer the Bhagavat on this same question using different phrases and different words And it would be the same if the Bhagavat questioned me on the same subject for a day, or a night, or even seven days and seven nights 46 Nidanasamyukt, p 203-204: Athanyataro bhiksur yena bhagavams tenopajagama / upetya bhagavatpadau sirasa vaditvaikante sthat / ekantasthitah sa bhiksur bhagavantam idam avocat / ayusmata bhadanta sariputrena udararsabhi vag bhasitaikamsa udgrhitah parisadi samyaksimhanado naditah / apratisam viditam mam  Tatha hi sariputrasya bhiksor dharmadhatuh supratividdhah // Transl - Then a certain bhiksu went to where the Buddha was, and, having gone there, he bowed to the Buddha’s feet and stood to one side; standing to one side, he said to the Buddha: Lord, a noble speech, a bull’s speech, a categorical statement, was made by Sariputra, and in the assembly he uttered a real lion’s roar, saying: While I was ignorant of his meaning, etc [The Buddha replied]: Truly, the dharmadhatu has been well penetrated by the bhiksu Sariputra The bhiksu who denounced to the Buddha what he belived to be Sariputra’s boasting was named Kaḷara: cf Samyutta, II, p 50 On the adjective arsabha, see above, p 1592F, note 1 When the canonical sutras say the the dharmadhatu has been well penetrated (supratividdha) by the Buddha or by Sariputra (cf Digha, II, p 8, l 13-14; p 53, l 13-14; Majjhima, I, p 396, l 10; Samyutta, II, p 56, l 4), they have in mind the Hinayana dharmata, namely the pratityasamutpada (cf Samyutta, II, p 25, l 17 foll) For the Mahayana, the dharmadhatu is the true nature of dharmas (dharmata) which has, as sole nature, the absence of nature 1811In the sravaka system, the nature of production and cessation (utpadanirodhalaksana) of all dharmas is considered to be tathata, whereas in reality it is necessary to eliminate all views (darsana) in order to discover the true nature of dharmas (bhutalaksana or dharmata) In the passage cited here it was a question of the dharmadhatu [298b] Question - In the passages [of the Bhiksusutra and the Sariputrasimhanadasutra which you have just cited], it speaks only of tathata and dharmadhatu Where then is it a question of bhutakoti? Answer - As there were reasons to mention these two things, [namely, the tathata and the dharmadhatu], these two sutras cited here spoke of them47 But since there was no reason to mention the bhutakoti, they did not speak of it Question - But the bhutakoti is nirvana, and it is with nirvana in mind that the Buddha preached the holy twelve-membered texts (dvadasangadharmapravacana) Why then do you claim that there was no reason to speak [about the bhutakoti]? Answer - There are all kinds of names (nanavidha naman) to designate nirvana: sometimes it is called detachment (viraga), sometimes perfection (pranita), sometimes deliverance (nihsarana)48 These synonyms serve to designate the bhutakoti If [the sutras cited here] did not use the latter term, we say it is because there was no reason to do so IV SUPPLEMENTARY EXPLANATIONS 1) Let us return to the sarvadharmanam tathatathe manner of being of all dharmas At the moment when dharmas are not yet arisen (ajata) and at the moment of their arising (jatisamaye) dharmas are thus’ (tatha) Once arisen, whether they are past (atita) or present (pratyutpanna), they are are also thus’ (tatha) This sameness of dharmas throughout the three times is called tathata Question - Dharmas not yet arisen (ajata) do not <2196> have birth (jatidharma); when present (pratyutpanna), they have this dharma of birth and are capable of functioning, for present dharmas have a nature of activity (karitralaksana); the recalling of past dharmas (atitvastusmarana) is called the past (atita) The three times, each of which is different, cannot be truly identical (sama) Why then do you claim that the tathata is the identity of the three times (tryadhvasamata)? Answer - In the true nature of dharmas (bhutalaksana or dharmata), the three times are identical and not different Where the sravakas speak of dependent origination (pratityasamutpada), the bodhisattvas speak of non-production (anutpada): see above, p 351F 47 The punctuation of the Taishß should be corrected; the period should be placed after chouo 48 On the synonyms for nirvana, see L de La Vallee Poussin, Nirvana, p 150-154 1812As is said in the Prajnaparamita[sutra] in the Jou p’in chapter (Tathataparivarta): The past tathata, the future tathata, the present tathata and the tathata of the Tathagata are one and the same tathata and are no different49 Moreover, previously (p 2062F), in the present Louen-yi (Upadesa),50 I have refuted the arising-dharma (utpadadharma) If there is no arising, the future (anagata) and the present (pratyutpanna) are also without arising Then how would the three times not be identical? What is more, past time (atitadhvan) is without beginning (anadika), future time (anagatadhvan) is without end (ananta) and present time (pratyutpannadhvan) is without duration (asthitika) This is why the identity of the three times (tryadvasamata) is called the tathata [of dharmas] 2) Having cultivated the tathata, the practitioner enters into the immense dharmadhatu The dharmadhatu is nirvana; it is indivisible (abhedya) and eludes futile proliferation (nisprapanca) The dharmadhatu is the fundamental element (maulabhaga) Just as in yellow rock (pitapasana) there is gold ore (suvarnadhatu), just as in white rock (panḍarapasmana) there is silver ore (rajatadhatu), so, in all the dharmas of the world, there is the nirvana-ore’ (nirvanadhatu)51 By their wisdom (prajna), their skillful means (upaya), their morality (sila) and their meditative absorptions (samadhi), the Buddhas and the saints (satpurusa) ripen (paripacayanti) beings and lead <2197> (upanayanti) them to find this nirvana-dharmadhatu Beings with sharp faculties (tiksnendriya) know that all dharmas are dharmadhatu: these beings are like people having the superknowledge of magic (rddhyabhijna) who are able to transform (parinam-) bricks into gold Beings of weak faculties (mrdvindriya) carefully scrutinize dharmas and finally find the dharmadhatu in them: they are like workers in a big foundry who breakup rock and finally find gold Moreover, the waters (udaka) that naturally flow downward end up all together in the ocean, finally all becoming of one taste (ekarasa), [the taste of salt] It is the same for dharmas: their general characteristics (samanyalaksana) and the specific characteristics (svalaksana) all end up in the dharmadhatu and they become assimilated into the single nature (ekalaksana) [which is none other than the absence of nature: alaksana52]: that is the dharmadhatu The thunderbolt (vajra) at the top of a mountain (giryagra) gradually sinks down to the bottom of the diamond level (vajrabhumi) and there, rejoining its own element (prakrti or svabhava), it stops53 It is the 49 Pancavimsati, chap LIV: Tathataparivarta, T 223, k 16, p 335c10-17; T 220, vol VII, k 513, p 619c25-27 - Astasahasrika, p 623: Iti hi Subhutitathata catitanagatapratyutpannatathata ca tathagatatathata cadvayam etad advaidhikaram / evam sarvadharmatathata ca Subhutitathata cadvayam etad advaidhikaram // 50 As we have seen above (Vol III, Introduction, p vii-viiiF and p 1237F), the Traite presents itself under the name Upadesa, in Chinese Louen-yi 51 The image developed here leads me [Lamotte] to translate nirvanadhatu as nirvana-ore’, but the meaning is more complex; cf L de La Vallee Poussin, Nirvana, p 155, 172 52 See p 676F, 938F, 1376F, 1382F, 1621F, 1694F, 1703F, 1741F, 935F 53 The thunderbolt, cast by the powerful deities, strikes the summit of the mountains, passes through the earth (prthivi) and rejoins its natural element, the diamond level (vajrabhumi) where it dissolves Traditional cosmology does not 1813same with dharmas: when [298c] one analyzes and explores them wisely, one reaches the very center of the tathata and, on leaving this tathata, one enters into the intrinsic nature (prakrti <2198> or svabhava) The tathata without birth from the very beginning (adyanutpanna)54 and eliminating all futile proliferation (nispranca) is called dharmadhatu When the calf (vatsa) is tied up, it cries and bawls but, when it has found its mother again, it immediately stops crying It is the same with dharmas: many and diverse, they are dissimilar in being taken (parigraha) and being rejected (utsarga), but as soon as they are gathered into their dharmadhatu, they cease at once: there is no way to go beyond that (nasty utkramanasthanam) That is the dharmadhatu 3) Bhutakoti - As I have said above (p 2188F), the dharmadhatu is called true (bhuta); and the place of entry is called the highest point (koti) Furthermore, taken individually (pratyekam), dharmas are ninefold (nanavidha): 1) They have existence (bhava) 2) Each has its own attribution Thus the eye (caksus) and the ear (srotra) are equally derived from the four great elements (caturmahabhautika), but the eye alone can see whereas the ear does not have the power to see Or again, fire (tejas) has heat (usnatva) for attribution, but it cannot moisten 3) Each has its own power (bala) Thus fire has heat (usnatva) for power, and water has moistness (drava) for power 4) They each have their own causes (hetu) 5) They each have their own object (alambana) mention this vajrabhumi According to the Sarvastivadin system (Kosa, III, p 138-148), very close to the canonical sources (Digha, II, p 107; Samyutta, II, p 103), the receptacle world (bhajanaloka) rests on space (akasa) upon which are superimposed, in turn, the circle of wind (vayumanḍala) - solid and which cannot be shaken by the thunderbolt - the circle of the waters (apam manḍalam), the level of gold (kancanamayi bhumi) and finally the earth proper (prthivi) with its mountains (parvata), its continents (dvipa) and its outer surroundings, the cakravada The vajrabhumi of which the Traite is speaking here should be placed between the earth proper and the level of gold, and it is also on the level of gold that the vajrasana diamond seat’ rests - also called bodhimanḍa area of enlightenment’ - on which all the bodhisattvas sit to realize vajropamasamadhi and thus become arhat and Buddha (cf Kosa, III, p 145) - For this bodhimanḍa, see Vimalakirtinirdesa, French transl, p 199-200 note The Traite establishes close relationships between the bodhimanḍa and the vajrabhumi in every manner Pancavimsati, p 82, l 2-3, states that thanks to his dharmacaksus, the bodhisattva knows that such and such a bodhisattva will sit (nisatsyate) on the bodhimanḍa and such and such a bodhisattva will not Commenting on this passage, the Traite (T 1509, k 40, p 350a17-19) comments: If the bodhisattva sees that, in the place where such and such a bodhisattva is, there is, under the earth (prthivya adhastat), the Vajrabhumi to support this bodhisattva, and if he sees the devas, nagas and yaksas holding all kinds of offerings and coming to the bodhimanḍa, etc, he knows in advance that that particular bodhisattva will sit on the bodhimanḍa 54 Adopting the variant pen wei cheng 18146) They each have their own effect (phala) 7) They each have their own essence (prakrti) 8) They each have their own limits (paryanta) 9) They each have their own opening up (udghatana) and preparations (prayoga) When the dharmas arise, their existence and their other attributes make up nine things in all Knowing that these dharmas each have their existence and their full complement of attributes is the lower worldly tathata (avaratathata) - Knowing that these nine things finally end up in change (viparinama) and ruin (pariksaya) is the middling tathata (madhya tathata) - Just as the body that comes from impurities (asuci), even though it is bathed (dhauta) and adorned (alamkrta), finally returns <2199> to impurity,55 so dharmas are neither existent (sat) nor non-existent (asat), neither produced (utpanna) nor annihilated (niruddha) The absolute purity (atyantasuddhi) that destroys all consideration about the dharmas (dharmapariksa) is the higher tathata (agra tathata) Some say: In these nine things, there is a dharma called tathata, just as there is solidity (khakkhatatva) in earth (prthivi), moistness (dravatva) in water (ap-), warmth (tejas) in fire, movement (irana) in wind (vayu), and consciousness (vijnana) in mind (citta) Dharmas of this kind are called tathata [Paccayasutta]56 - Thus it is said in a sutra: Whether there are Buddhas or there are no Buddhas (utpadad va tathagatanam anutpadad va tathagatanam), the tathata, dharmata, dharmasthita remain in the world eternally, that is to say, the formations have ignorance as condition (yad idam avidyapratyayah samskarah): that is the eternal tathata, the primordial Law The dharmadhatu is the essence (prakrti or svabhava) in the nine things When one takes possession (prapnoti) of the realization of the fruit (phalasaksatkara),57 there is bhutakoti Moreover, the true nature of dharmas (bhutalaksana or dharmata) is eternally stable (sthita) and immobile (akopya) As a result of their passions, ignorance, etc, (avidyadiklesa), beings transform and distort this true nature The Buddha and the saints (satpurusa) preach the Dharma to them using all kinds of salvific means (nanavidhopaya) and annihilate their passions, ignorance, etc, so well that beings rediscover the true nature, primordial and unchanged, that is called tathata This true nature, in contact with ignorance (avidya), is transformed and becomes impure (asuddha); but if one eliminates ignorance, etc, one finds the 55 Compare the canonical topic mentioned above, p 1154F, n 1 56 Extract from the Pratityasutra of the Nidanasamyukta, p 148 (Tsa a han, T 99, no 296, k 12, p 84b12-c10) having as correspondent the Paccayasuttanta of the Samyutta, II, p 25, l 18-20: Utpadad va tathagatanam anutpadad va sthita eveyam dharmata dharmasthitaye dhatuh Uppada va tathagatanam anuppada va tathagatanam thita vo sa dhatu dhammathitata dhammaniyamata idappaccayata Sutra already cited, p 157F as n; 2087F, n 4 57 The saint does not produce (notpadayati) the dharmadhatu (= nirvana); he actualizes it (saksatkaroti); in technical terms, he takes possession (prapanoti) of the dharmadhatu 1815true nature It is called dharmadhatu, visuddhi, bhutakoti That is the entry into [299a] the dharmadhatu <2200> The dharmadhatu is immense (apramana), limitless (ananta), extremely subtle (suksma) and admirable (pranita) There is no dharma that surpasses the dharmadhatu or that diverges from it [In its presence], mind (citta) is fulfilled (aragayati) and, without looking for anything else, it actualizes it (saksatkaroti) The traveller who, day after day, has gone on without ever stopping, no longer has the idea of starting again It is the same for the yogin established in bhutakoti Take, for example, an arhat or pratyekabuddha who is established in bhutakoti: even if Buddhas as many as the sands of the Ganges (ganganadivalukopama) were to preach the Dharma to him, he would not progress any further [because he has attained his goal] Moreover, [having actualized nirvana], he is no longer reborn in the threefold world (traidhatuka) As for the bodhisattva entered into the dharmadhatu, it is uncertain whether he knows the bhutakoti Although he has not yet fully perfected (paripr-) the six perfections (paramita), he converts beings (sattvan paripacayati) If he realized [nirvana] at that time, that would prevent him from [some day] attaining the bodhi of the Buddhas From then on, by the power of his great compassion (mahakaruna) and his exertion (virya), the bodhisattva returns to exercising the practices Moreover, the bodhisattva knows that in the true nature of dharmas (bhutalaksana or dharmata) there is no eternal (nitya) dharma or happy (sukha) dharma or personal (atmaka) dharma or real (bhuta) dharma He also abandons these considerations of the dharmas (dharmapariksa) The cessation (nirodha) of all considerations of this kind is precisely the true tathata of dharmas, nirvana, non-production (anutpada), non-cessation (anirodha), primordial non-arising (adyanutpannatava)58 Thus, water is cold, but if it brought close to fire, it gets hot; when the fire is extinguished, the heat disappears and the water gets cold again as before Applying considerations of dharmas [to the tathata] is like bringing the water close to the fire; suppressing all considerations about dharmas is like extinguishing the fire so that the water becomes cold again That is the tathata, truly and eternally susbsistent Why is that? Because the dharmadhatu is like that Just as there is an empty aspect (sunyabhaga) in every material dharma (rupin), so there is a nature of nirvana <2201> called dharmadatu in dharmas The nature of nirvana is also in the many skillful means (upaya) used to attain nirvana At the time when nirvana is realized, tathata and dharmadhatu are bhutakoti Finally, the immense (apramana), limitless (ananta) dharmadhatu, unable to be measured by the mind and mental events (cittacaitta), is called dharmadhatu It is so wondrous that it is called bhutakoti Adhipatya Third Section MASTERING THE FOUR GREAT ELEMENTS 58 Adopting the variant pen wei cheng 1816Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 25, l 1-3; 27, l 8-18; Satasahasrika, p 81, l 11-82, l 6) - Furthermore, Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to calculate the number of subtle atoms contained in the great earth and mountains of the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu must practice the perfection of wisdom (punar aparam Sariputra trisahasramahasahasralokadhatau ye mahaprthiviparvataparamanas tan jnatukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) The bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if, after having cut a hair into a hundred pieces, he wishes, by means of only one of these pieces, to scatter into the air the waters contained in the great oceans, the rivers, the pools and the springs of the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu and to do that without harming the aquatic species therein (trisahasramahasahasralokadhatau yo mahasamudresv apskandho mahanadisu nadisu taḍagesu palvalesu tam sarvam satadha bhinnaya valagrakotyabhyutkseptukamena na ca tadasrayan pranino vihethayitukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Suppose that all the fires of the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu were lit at the same time like at the time of the great fire at the end of the kalpa The bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to blow them out with a single brteath from his mouth must practice the perfection of wisdom (yavams trisahasramahasahasra lokadhatav agniskandha ekajvalibhuto bhavet tad yathapi nama kalpoddahe vartamane, tam ekena mukhavatena prasamayitukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Suppose that all the great winds of the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu arose to sweep away with their breath the entire [299b] trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu and all the Mount Sumerus as if they were all just rotting grass If the bodhisattva-mahasattva wishes to stop the force of these winds <2202> with his finger- tip so that they do not arise, he must practice the perfection of wisdom (trisahasramahasahasralokadhatau ye vata imam trisahasramahasahasralokadhatum sameruparvatam vidhvamsayeyus tad yathapi nama bisamustitam, tan sarvan ekenanguliparvagrena samcchadayitukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - I MASTERING THE EARTH ELEMENT Question - Why does the Buddha not praise the qualities (guna) of the bodhisattva, such as the six perfections (satparamita), but rather he praises this great power (mahabala) [consisting of mastering the four elements]? Answer - Beings are of two types: i) those who love the good dharmas (kusaladharma); ii) those who love the fruits of ripening (vipakaphala) resulting from the good dharmas For those who love the good dharmas the Buddha praises the qualities (guna); for those who love the fruits of ripening resulting from the good dharmas he praises great magical power (maharddhibala) 1817Moreover, some say that the fame enjoyed by the great elements (mahabhuta) is well justified: they are infinite (ananta), indestructible (aksaya) and always present in the world; this is why there is nobody who is able to measure their dimensions exactly People build cities (nagara) and palaces (prasada), but the materials they use are insignificant (atyalpa) The earth (prthivi) itself is very extensive (vistirna), it supports the ten thousand things and is very solid (drḍha) This is why the Buddha says here that in order to know fully the number of subtle atoms (paramanu) contained in the earth (prthivi) and the Mount Sumerus of the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu and in order to know the respective part beings hold in regard to their actions, it is necessary to practice the perfection of wisdom Question - The subtle atoms contained in a single stone (pasana) are already difficult to count; what can be said of the subtle atomes contained in the earth and mountains of the trisahasramahasmahasralokadhatu? It is unbelievable [that they can be counted] Answer - The sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are unable to know them and, still less, the worldly people (prthagjana), but this number is known by the Buddhas and the great bodhisattvas <2203> [Saddharmapunḍarikasutra]59 - Thus it is said in the Fa-houa king (Dharmapunḍarikasutra): <2204> 59 Saddharmapunḍarika, VII, Purvayogaparivarta, p 156, l 5-157, l 8 (compare Kashgar version, p 26, l 7-25; Gilgit version, p 74, l 7-21) -Tcheng fa houa king, transl Dharmaraksa, T 263, k 4, p 88b24-c10; Miao fa lien houa king, transl Kumarajiva, T 262, k 3, p 22a23-b3 Tadyathapi nama bhiksavo yavan iha trisahasramahasahasre lokadhatau prthividhatus tam kascid eva purusah sarvam curnikuryan masimkuryat / atha khalu sa purusas tasmal lokadhator ekam paramanurajo grhitva purvasyam disi lokadhatusahasram atikramya tadekam paramanuraja upaniksipet / atha sa dvitiyam ca paramanurajo grhiva tatah parena parataram lokadhatusahasram atikramya dvitiyam paramanuraja upaniksipet / anena paryayena sa purusah sarvavantam prthividhatum upaniksipet purvasyam disi / tat kim manyadhve bhiksavah sakyam tesam lokadhatunam anto va paryanto va gananayadhigantum / ta ahuh / no hidam bhagavan no hidam sugata / bhagavan aha / sakyam punar bhiksavas tesam lokadhatunam kenacid ganakena ganakamahamatrena va ganananaya paryanto dhigantum yesu vopaniksitani tani paramanurajamsi yesu va nopaniksiptani / na tv eva tesam kalpakotinayutasatasahasranam sakyam gananayogena paryanto dhigantum / yavantah kalpas tasya bhagavato mahabhijnajnanabhibhuvas tathagatasya parinirvrtasyaitavan sa kalo bhud evam acintya evam apramanah / tam caham bhiksavas tathagatam tavacciram parinirvrtam anena tathagatajnanadarsanabaladhanena yathadya svo va parinirvrtam anusmarami / Transl - It is, O momks, as if a man reduced the earth element of this trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu to powder or dust Then, let him take a pinch of extremely fine dust in this universe, let him go to a thousand universes in the eastern direction and scatter this extremely fine dust there Next let this man take a second pinch of extremely fine dust, go to a thousand universes beyond the first and scatter this second pinch of dust there; let him dispose in this way the entirety of this earth element in the eastern direction What do you think, O monks? Is it possible to calculate the total number of universes [thus reached]? The monks said: That is not possible, O Bhagavat; that is not possible, O Sugata The Bhagavat continued: On the contrary, O monks, it is possible that a great mathematician, a great master of arithmetic, could calculate the total number of these universes, as many as those where the extremely fine dust was 1818[Addressing the bhiksus, the Buddha said to them:] It is as if a man reduced to dust (curnikuryat) the earth and mountains of the present trisahasramahasahasralokdhatu, then, [taking a pinch of this dust], he crossed over a thousand universes of the eastern direction and there set down this dust; next, [taking a second pinch of dust] he crossed over a thousand universes [beyond the first thousand] and there set down [the second pinch of dust]; finally in the same way, he used up all the dust of the present trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu Then the Buddha asked the bhiksus: Is it possible to know by calculation (ganana) the number of pinches of dust and the universes? The bhiksus answered: It is impossible The Buddha replied: On the contrary, it is possible to attain [by calculation] the total number (sakyam gananaya paryanto dhigantum) of these universes, as well as those in which the dust was not put As for the number of kalpas that have elapsed since the buddha Ta-t’ong-houei (Mahabhijnajnanabhibhu) appeared in the world, it is like the fine dust contained in universes as numerous as the sands of innumerable Ganges (apramanaganganadivalukopama) And the Buddhas and the great bodhisattvas, however, know it all; all the more reason when it is only a matter of universes as numerous as the sands of one single Ganges disposed, as many as those where it was not disposed On the contrary, it is not possible, by calculation, to reach the total number of hundreds of thousands of kotinayutas of kalpas that have elapsed since the Bhagavat Mahabhijnajnanabhibhu entered into complete nirvana, so great, so inconceivable, so immense is the time [separating us from it] And moreover, O monks, I myself, by using the power of knowledge and vision of a tathagata, remember this tathagata Mahabhijnajnanabhibhu, who entered complete nirvana so long ago, as though his parinirvana had taken place yesterday or today - This passage of the Lotus has been translated twice by Kumarajiva, once in his Chinese version of the Traite (T 1509, k 32, p 299b17-24) finished at Siao-yao-yuan at Tch’ang-ngan on the 27th day of the 7th year of the hong-che period, ie, February 1, 406 (see above, Vol III, Introduction, p XLV); a second time in his Chinese version of the Saddharmapunḍarika T 262, k 3, p 22a23-b3) finished a few months later at Ta-sseu at Tch’ang-ngan during the summer of the 8th year of the hong-che period, also 406 (cf Tch’ou,T 2145, k 2, p 10c19; K’ai-yuan, T 2154, k 4, p 512b23-24) The second translation is more literal than the first and, for this passage at least, it does not seem that Kumarajiva was inspired by the translation of the Lotus (T 263, k 4, p 88b24-c10) made previously by Dharmaraksa who had begun the 10th day of the 8th month of the 7th year of the t’ai-k’ang period, ie, September 15, 286 (cf K’ai- yuan, T 2145, k 2, p 494a15) According to Japanese research, the Lotus sutra cited in the Traite seems to have been a version in the middle of Kumarajiva’s original and Dharmaraksa’s original: see H Nakamura, A Survey of Mahayana Buddhism with bibliographical notes, Part I, Jour of Intercultural Studies, 3 (1976), p 97 It would be interesting to know which Sanskrit version - the version from Nepal, Kashgar or Gilgit - it most closely resembles 1819Furthermore, speaking of immense’ (apramana) things is to conform to the human point of view Thus it is said that the waters of the great ocean are immense when they have the depth of eighty thousand yojanas,60 and Lo heou (Rahu), king of the Asuras, has no problem in measuring it61 Question - How does one obtain such a science [of measuring] by practicing the Prajnaparamita? Answer - There are men who, by practicing the Prajnaparamita, <2205> destroy the conflicting emotions (klesa), wrong views (mithyadrsti), futile chatter [299c] (prapanca), and penetrate into the very profound dhyanas and absorptions (samapatti) of the bodhisattvas By the purity and extent of their memory (smrti) and their knowledge (jnana), they are able to distinguish the subtle atoms (paramanu) of all the substances (rupa) and know their number Moreover, the Buddhas and the great bodhisattvas who have obtained the unhindered liberations (anavaranavimoksa) do not consider calculations higher than that to be difficult (krcchra) and, still less, that calculation Moreover, there are people for whom the solidity (drḍhatva) of the earth (prthivi) and the absence of shape (samsthana) of the mind (citta) are wrong This is why the Buddha has said that the power of the mind (cittabala) is great By cultivating the Prajnaparamita, this great earth (mahaprthivi) is reduced to its subtle atoms (paramanu) Because the earth element possesses color (rupa), odor (gandha), taste (rasa) and touch (sprastavya), it is heavy (guru) and does not have activity (kriya) on its own - Because the water (ap-) element has no taste (rasa), it is superior to earth by means of its movement (calana) - Because the fire (tejas) element has neither odor (gandha) nor taste (rasa), it is superior to water in its power (prabhava) - Because the wind (vayu) element is neither visible (rupa) nor has it any taste (rasa) or touch (sprastavya), it is superior to fire by means of its movement (irana) - The mind (citta) which has none of these four things [color, taste, smell and touch] has a still greater power62 <2206> 60 Kosa, III, p 143 61 See p 2091F 62 According to the Pancavastuka, ed J Imanishi, p 6-7, reproduced at the beginning of the Prakaranapada (T 1541, k 1, p 627a; T 1542, k 1, p 692b), matter (rupa) is the four great elements (mahabhuta) and the material derived from the four great elements (mahabhutany upadayarupa) The four great elements are the elements (dhatu) earth (prthivi), water (ap-), fire (tejas) and wind (vayu) Derived matter, also called bhautika rupa, is: i) the five derived organic materials, namely: the organs (indriya) of the eye (caksus), ear (srotra), nose (ghrana), tongue (jihva) and body (kaya) ii) the five inorganic derived materials, namely, color (rupa), sound (sabda), odor (gandha), taste (rasa), part of touch (sprastavyaikadesa) and non-information (avijnapti) The Traite adds here that, taken in abstracto and individually, the four great elements do not support the same number of inorganic derived materials: earth (prthivi) supports color, odor, taste and touch (cf Kosa, IX, p 288); water (ap-) has no taste; fire (tejas) has no odor or taste; wind (vayu) has no color, no taste and no touch 1820But when the mind abounds in afflictive emotions (klesa), in fetters (samyojana) and bonds (bandhana), its power is very small (atyalpa) Impure but good minds (sasravakusalacitta) have no afflictive emotions; however, since they still grasp characteristics (nimittany udgrhnanti), their power is small (alpa) also In adepts of the two Vehicles, [sravaka and pratyekabuddha], pure minds no longer grasp characteristics and, nevertheless, since the wisdom of these adepts is limited, as soon as they leave the pure Path (anasravamarga), their six organs (saḍindriya) [begin again] to imagine and to grasp the characteristics of dharmas (dharmanimitta), and this is why they do not exhaust all the power of mind (cittabala) By contrast, in the Buddhas and great bodhisattvas, wisdom is immense (apramana), unlimited (ananta), always deep in the dhyanas and the meditative absorptions (samapatti) There is no difference between samsara and nirvana The True nature of dharmas (bhutalaksana or dharmata) is true (bhuta) and undifferentiated (abhinna) Taken by itself, knowledge (jnana) is both good and bad, but, in those who cultivate the Prajnaparamita, it is absolutely pure (atyantavisuddha) and free of obstacles (apratigha) In one moment they can count the subtle atoms (paramanu) contained in the great earth and the mountains of trisahasramahasahasralokadhatus as numerous in each of the ten directions (dasasu diksu) as the sands of all the Ganges (sarvaganganadivalukopama), and all the more so, those contained in each of the ten directions in universes as many as the sands of a single Ganges Finally, although outside of the Prajnaparamita one is able to conquer the superknowledge of magic (rddhyabhijna), the latter will never equal the [mathematical] knowledge of which I have just spoken This is why the Prajnaparamita says that in order to obtain this great power of magic (maharddhibala), it is necessary to practice the perfection of wisdom <2207> II MASTERING THE WATER ELEMENT Some say that water (ap-) is the greatest of all substances Why? Because at the zenith (urdhvam), at the nadir (adhas) and at the four cardinal points (dis) of the great earth (mahaprthivi), there is no place where there is no water If the Lokapala gods did not moderate the rain (varsa) of the heavenly nagas and if there A great element is the more subtle and the more powerful the smaller the number of derived substances it supports: the wind, which supports only odor, is the strongest of the four great elements But all of this is theoretical, for the great elements never appear in the form of isolated subtle atom (paramanu) but in the form of conglomerates of atoms (samghataparamanu) or, if one wishes, molecules The molecule into which sound does not enter, into which no organ enters, involves eight substances (astadravyaka) at least, namely: the four great elements (catvari mahabhutani) and four derived substances (catvary upadayarupani): color, odor, taste and touch (cf Kosa, II, p 144-145) The mind (citta), which is non-material (arupin) and has no derived substance to support, is infinitely more subtle (suksma) than the most subtle of the four great elements That is why the Buddha said that its power is very great 1821were no jewel (mani) to disperse the waters,63 heaven and earth would collapse Furthermore, it is as a result of the waters that the classes of animate (sattva) and inanimate (asattva) beings in the world take birth (jati) and grow (vrddhi) That is why we can know that water is very great This is why the Buddha says here that the bodhisattva who wishes to know the number of drops of water (bindu) and to disperse them drop by drop so that they have no more power, must practice the perfection of wisdom III MASTERING THE FIRE ELEMENT Some say that the fire element (tejas) is the greatest Why? Because it has [300a] no odor (gandha) or taste (rasa) and because if water greatly overflows its banks, fire can destroy it The power of fire is so great that it can burn the ten thousand things and illuminate all the shadows (andhakara) From that, we know that fire is very great This is why the Buddha says here that the bodhisattva who wishes to extinguish the great fire by his breath (mukhavata) should practice the perfection of wisdom Question - But it is thanks to the wind (vata) that fire is finally kindled (jvalibhavati); how then do [wind and fire] mutually destroy each other? Answer - Although they are mutual causes, they destroy each other in time Question - So be it But fire is immense (apramana), whereas <2208> the bodhisattva’s breath (mukhavata) is very small (atyalpa); how can it destroy fire? Answer - Thanks to his dhyanas and absorptions (samapatti), the bodhisattva who is cultivating the Prajnaparamita attains a magical superknowledge (rddhyabhijna) thanks to which he can change (parinam- ) his body and make it bigger The breath from his mouth (mukhavata) equally increases and can extinguish the fire Moreover, thanks to magical power (rddhibala), a small wind is able to destroy, just as a small thunderbolt (vajra) is able to break up a big mountain This is why, in view of this magical power, gods and men all submit Furthermore, because fire devastates vast spaces, the bodhisattva has compassion (anukampate) for beings and destroys the fire by his magical power 63 The jewel for dispersing the waters, siao chouei tchou, is different from the jewel for purifying water ts’ing chouei tchou (in Sanskrit, udakaprasadakamani) which the Traite will mention later (T 1509, k 36, p 325c21): It is like the clear water of a pool: when a mad elephant enters it, it turns into a quagmire; but if the jewel for purifying water enters into it, the water becomes pure For the latter, see also Suvikrantavikripariprccha, T 231, k 6, p 717b19; Satyasiddhisastra, T 1646, k 4, p 266a5; Milindapanha, p 35, l 8 (udakappasadako mani) and its Chinese versions: T 1670A, k 1, p 697b5; T 1670B, k 1, p 707c4; P Demieville, Les versions chinoises du Milindapanha, BEFEO, XXIV (1924), p 105, n 4; Visuddhimagga, ed H C Warren, p 393, l 6 1822Finally, establishing a trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu is very difficult, but by his merits (punya) and his wisdom (prajna), the bodhisattva is able to govern it IV MASTERING THE WIND ELEMENT Some say that, of the four great elements (mahabhuta), the power of the wind (vayu) is the greatest Having neither form (rupa) nor odor (gandha) nor taste (rasa), its mobility (irana) is very great Just as space (akasa) is infinite, so wind too is infinite The success or failure of giving birth depends on wind64 The power (prabhava) of the great winds shakes the mountains of the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu This is why the Buddha says here that the bodhisattva who wishes to stop the force of the winds with one finger should practice the perfection of wisdom Why? Because the true nature (dharmata) of the Prajnaparamita is immense (apramana) and infinite (ananta), it can make the finger have such strength <2209> Akasadhatuspharana Fourth Section FILLING ALL OF SPACE Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 28, l 1-2; Satasahasrika, 82, l 6-9) - Furthermore, Sariputra, the bodhisattva- mahasattva should practice the perfection of wisdom if he wants, by means of one single paryanka (by sitting cross-legged), to fill the entire space element in the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu (Punar aparam Sariputra yas trisahasramahasahasre lokadhatav akasadhatus tam sarvam ekena paryankena spharitukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Question - Why does the bodhisattva sit cross-legged (paryankam abhujya nisidati) in this way?65 Answer - Brahma Devaraja, who rules the trisaharalokadhatu, had some wrong ideas (mithyadrsti) and considered himself to be great But when he saw the Bodhisattva, sitting cross-legged and filling space, his proud thoughts (manacitta)66 vanished 64 Cf Kosabhasya, p 130, l 6-8: Tasya khalu kalanatarena paripakapraptasya garbhasalyasyabhyantarat matuh kuksau karmavipakaja vayavo vanti ye tam garbhasalyam samparivarttya matuh kayavaksaradvarabhimukham avasthapayanti / sa krurapurisapinḍa ivatimatram sthanat pracyuto duhkham samparivarttyate / - Later, when the embryo, this thorn, has come to maturity inside the womb, there arise the winds arisen from the maturation of actions, which turn the embryo and push it towards the gate of impurity of the mother’s body This embryo, removed from its place, such a mass of bloody excrement, is painfully handled 65 For the paryanka and the benefits of this position, see above, p 432-433F 66 Brahma Devaraja’s pride has already been mentioned above, p 561-562F, 2079F, n 2 1823Moreover, by his skillful means (upayakausalya) coming from this magical superknowledge (eko pi bhutva bahudha bhavati), being many, he becomes one (bahudhapi bhutvaiko bhavati), being small he becomes large, being large he becomes small and, if he wants to manifest extraordinary things (ascarya), he is able to sit and fill all of space (akasa) Finally, it is in order to prevent the asuras and the nagarajas from tormenting beings that the Bodhisattva sits and fills space, thus assuring the safety of beings (sattvaksema) [Nandopanandanagarajadamanasutra]67 - Thus, when the nagarajas Nan-t’o (Nanda) and P’o-nan-t’o (Upananda), the older and the younger, wanted to destroy the city of Sravasti, they rained down weapons (ayudha) and poisonous [300b] snakes (asivisa), but Mou-lien (Maudgalyayana), at that time properly seated, filled space and changed the offensive weapons into perfumed flowers and necklaces (hara) This is why the Prajnaparamita says here that the bodhisattva-mahasattva should practice the perfection of wisdom if, by means of a single paryanka, he wants to fill all the space in the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu <2210> Ekapinḍapata Fifth Section CASTING THE MOUNT SUMERUS FAR AWAY Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 28, l 2-5; Satasahasrika, p 82, l 9-12) - Furthermore, the bodhisattva- mahasattva should practice the perfection of wisdom if he wants, by means of a single hair, having raised up all the Sumerus, king of the mountains, in the trisahasramahasasralokadhatu, to cast them beyond innumerable and incalculable universes, without harming the beings in them (Punar aparam trisahasramahasahasralokadhatau ye sumeruparvatarajas tan sarvan ekena valenabhyutksipyaprameyan asamkhyeyan lokadhatun samtikramya praksipeyam na tu sattvan vihethayeyam iti bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Question - How can the bodhisattva raise the Mount Sumerus and the mountains and cast them far away beyond the innumerable universes of the other directions? Answer - He has no need of a lever, and this emphasizes the power of the bodhisattva who is able to lift up the mountains Moreover, when the Buddha is going to preach the Dharma, the bodhisattvas first adorn the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu and remove the mountains so that the ground is leveled out (sama) 67 For this sutra, see p 189F, n 3; 1359F, n 3 1824[Saddharmapunḍarikasutra]68 - See what was said in the Fa-houa king (Dharmapunḍarikasutra): When the buddha [Sakyamuni] <2211> was about to join the emanated buddhas (nirmita buddha), he first leveled out the ground and also, wanting to manifest extraordinary things (adbhuta), he made it so that beings could see them How is that? Each Mount Sumeru has a height of 84,000 yojanas69 To raise up one single Sumeru is already extraordinary (adhbhuta); to say nothing about [when the Bodhisattva raises] the hundred kotis70 of Sumerus in the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu; to say nothing about raising with a single hair (ekena valagrena) the hundred kotis of Sumerus in the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu and casting them out beyond innumerable (aprameya) and incalculable (asamkhyeya) universes The beings who see this extraordinary exploit of the bodhisattva all produce the mind of supreme complete enlightenment (anuttarasamyak-sambodhicitta) and have the following thought: If this bodhisattva who has not yet attained the bodhi of the Buddhas possesses such magical power (rddhibala), what will it be when he becomes Buddha? That is why the Prajnaparamitasutra spoke thus 68 Saddharmapunḍ, chap XI - While the Buddha Sakyamuni was preaching the Lotus in the Saha universe, a stupa appeared in the sky; in this stupa was enclosed the body of the tathagata Prabhutaratna In order to pay homage to him, Sakyamuni miraculously created from his own body a large number of forms of the Tathagata which, in the ten directions of space, each in the different Buddha fields, taught the Dharma to beings All these Tathagatas decided to go to the Saha universe in the presence of the Buddha Sakyamuni to see and venerate the stupa of Prabhutaratna There appeared with them in the Saha universe twenty hundreds of thousands of myriads of kotis of Buddha fields, marvelously decorated, without villages, without cities and without mountains Then, continues the Saddharmapunḍarika (p 245-246): Atha khalu punar bhagavan sakyamunis tathagato rhan samyaksambuddhas tesam tathagatavigrahanam agantanam avakasam nirmimite sma /  tani ca sarvani bahubuddhaksetrany ekam eva prthivipradesam parisamsthapayam asa samam ramaniyam saptaratnamayais ca vrksais citritam - Then the blessed Tathagata Sakyamuni, arhat, completely and fully enlightened, created a space to contain these tathagata-forms that had just arrived  All these numerous Buddha fields Sakyamuni established as a single Buddha land, flat, pleasant, embellished with trees made of the seven jewels According to the Traite, the intention of the leveling of the ground and the disappearance of the mountains carried to other universes was to render the miracle visible to the eyes of all The Traite refers to the same chapter of the Lotus above, p 417-418F 69 Sumeru is 84,000 yojanas in length, 84,000 yojanas in width, plunges into the water to a depth of 84,000 yojanas and emerges from the water to a height of 84,000 yojanas Anguttara, IV, p 100: Sineru pabbataraja caturasitiyojanasahassani ayamena caturasitiyojanasahassani vitharena caturasitiyojanasahassani mahasamudde ajjhogaḷho caturasitiyojanasahassani mahasamudda accuggato See also Atthasalini, p 298, l 13-14; Kosa, III, p 143 70 A hundred kotis, ie, a billion, koti here being equal to 10,000,000 (cf Kosa, III, p 189, l 34) See above, p 448F and n The universe of four continents contains only one Sumeru, but in a trisahasramahasahasra, this number is 1000 carried to the third power, ie, a billion 1825Sixth Section HONORING ALL THE BUDDHAS BY MEANS OF A SINGLE OFFERING Sutra (cf Pancvimsati, p 28, l 11-15; Satasahastika, p 82, l 16-85, l 10) - The bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes, by means of one and the same morsel of food, to satisfy all the Buddhas and their disciples present in each of the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges The bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes, by means of one and the same object (garment, flower, perfume, necklace, powder, unguent, incense, lamp, banner, parasol, etc) to honor all the Buddhas and their disciples (Yavanto dasasu diksu ganganadivalukopamesu lokadhatusu buddha bhagavantah sasravakasamghas tan sarvan ekena pinḍapatena pratipadayitukamena bodhisattvena <2112> mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam Yavanto buddha bhagantah sasravakasamghas tan sarvan ekavastrapuspagandhaharacurnavilepanadhupadipadhvajapatakacchattrena pujayitukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Question - To offer one and the same morsel of food (ekapinḍapata) to a single Buddha and his monks is already difficult (duskara); to say nothing of the bodhisattva offering this morsel to Buddhas and their samghas in each of the ten directions, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges?71 Answer - The merit of the offering (pujapunya) resides in the intention (citta) and not in the thing offered It is with a great intention that the bodhisattva offers this single morsel to all the Buddhas and all their samghas of the ten [300c] directions Whether they are far (dure) or near (santike) is unimportant This is why all the Buddhas see (pasyanti) this offering and accept it (pratighrnanti) Question - All these Buddhas have omniscience (sarvajnana) and consequently see the offering and accept it; but the monks themselves do not have omniscience; how could they see it and accept it? Answer - The monks neither see it nor know it, and yet the donor (dayaka) of the offering gains merit (punya) Thus, when a man sends a messenger to carry an offering to another, even if this other person does not receive it, the man gains the offering of the gift Also, in the concentration of loving-kindness (maitrisamadhi), even though nothing is given to the beings [who are the object],72 the yogin [who is practicing it] gains an immense merit Furthermore, the bodhisattvas are endowed with immense and unchanging qualities (apramanaksaragunasampanna); when they offer a single morsel (pinḍapata) to all the Buddhas and their samghas of the ten directions, the latter are satisfied and yet the morsel is not used up, like a plentiful 71 In other words, to satisfy one Buddha and his samgha by a single ball of rice is already difficult It is still more difficult to satisfy, with this single morsel, an incalculable number of Buddhas and samghas 72 See above, p 1240F 1826(udbhida) spring the output of which does not dry up73 <2213> Thus, when Manjusri offered a bowl of little cakes (modaka) to 84,000 monks, all of them were satisfied but the cakes were not used up Moreover, here the bodhisattva offers only one single bowl of food to all the Buddhas of the ten directions and, after having eaten it, the Buddhas are satisfied and go away In contrast, the pretas, although each of them receives a mouthful of food, come back thousands of myriads of times [to get more] Finally, the bodhisattva who cultivates the Prajnaparamita acquires immense gates of dhyanas and absorptions (apramanadhyanasamapattimukha), immense gates of wisdom and skillful means (apramanaprajnopayamukha): that is why there is nothing he is unable to do Since the Prajnaparamita encounters no obstacle (anavarana), the mind (citta) and activity (kriya) of the bodhisattva as well encounter no obstacles This bodhisattva is able to honor the Buddhas and their samghas as numerous in each of the ten directions as the sands of a thousand myriads of Ganges; a fortiori, he is able to honor those of a single Ganges It is the same [when the bodhisattva wants to honor all the Buddhas and their samghas by offering them only a single thing]: a garment (vastra), flower (puspa), perfume (gandha), necklace (hara), powser (curna), unguent (vilepana), incense (dhupa), lamp (dipa), banner (dhvajapataka), parasol (chattra), etc Margaphalesu pratisthapanam Seventh Section ESTABLISHING ALL BEINGS IN THE FRUITS OF THE PATH Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 28, l 16-29, l 3; Satasahasrika, p 85, l 10-90, l 9) - Furthermore, Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva should practice the perfection of wisdom if he wants to establish all beings in universes as numerous in each of the ten directions as the sands of the Ganges [in the fruits of the Path]; if he wants to establish them: 1) in the [pure] aggregates of morality, concentration, wisdom, deiverance, and the knowledge and vision of deliverance; 2) in the fruit of entry into the stream; 3) in the fruit of the once- returner;

having transmigrated, having passed seven times among gods and men, he will realize the end of suffering - Compare Mahavibhasa, T 1545, k 46, p 237c26-29 The phrasing is shorter in the Pali suttas (Digha, I, p 156; II, p 92, 200, 252; III, p 107, 132; Majjhima, I, p 34, 226; III, p 81; Samyutta, V, p 357, 379; Anguttara, I, p 231-232: II, p 88-89, 238): Idha bhikkhu tinnam samyojananam parikkhaya sotapanno hoti avinipatadhammo niyato sambodhiparayano The Sarvastivadin scholasticism (Satpadabhidharma, Mahavibhasa, Kosa, etc) proposes a more elaborate definition of the srotaapattiphala: it establishes a difference between the conditioned (samskrta) and the unconditioned (asamskrta) fruits and, aside from the elimination of the three fetters (samyojana) calls upon the elimination of the 88 perverse tendencies (anusaya) This is the definition which the Traite summarizes here, referring to the Abhidharma Dharmaskandha, T 1537, k 3, p 464c17-26: At that time the Bhagavat was dwelling at Sravasti in the Jetavana, in the garden of Anathapinḍada He said to the assembly of monks: There are four fruits of the religious life (sramanyaphala): srotaapattiphala, sakrdagamiphala, anagamiphala and arhattvaphala Briefly, there are two kinds of srotaapattiphala: samskrta and asamskrta The samskrta srotaapattiphala is in the possession (prapti) of this fruit and the grasping of this possession The (six) indriyas and the (six) balas of the saiksa, the ascetic who is still practicing’, the sila of the saiksa, the kusalamulas of the saiksa, the eight margangas of the saiksa, as well as all the saiksadharmas of the same class are called samskrta srotaapattiphala - The definitive elimination of the three samyojanas and the definitive destruction of the samyojanadharmas of the same class, namely the definitive destruction of 88 anusayas and the definitive destruction of the samyojanadharmas of the same class are called asamskrta srotaapattiphala - We should remember that the three samyojanas in question here are part of the group of five samyojanas described as lower (avarabhaga), ie, of kamadhatu (Kosa, V, p 84-85) The 88 anusayas are part of a group of 98 anusayas of which the first 88 are to be abandoned by the seeing of the truths (darsanaheya) and the last ten by 1828b When they are in the subsequent knowledge concerning [the truth] of the path (marge nvayajnana), the ascetic who has sought [the truth] by means of faith (sraddhanusarin) and the ascetic who has sought [the truth] by means of scripture (dharmanusarin) have acquired the realization of the fruit of entry into the stream (srotaapattiphalasaksatkara)77 The Chinese characters Siu-t’o (srotas) mean stream’, ie, the noble eightfold Path (arya astangikamarga) The characters Pan-na (apanna) means [301a] entry’ To enter into the noble eightfold Path is to enter into the stream of nirvana: that is the first vision of the true nature of dharmas (dharmanam bhutalaksanam or dharmata) By successfully entering into this part of the immense dharmadhatu, one is classed among the aryas78 3) The characters Si-ki (sakrt) mean a single time’; k’ie-mi (agamin) means who comes back’79 The ascetic so named, having left this world and taken rebirth among the gods, comes back from there one single time [into the world of men] and there finds the end to suffering80 <2216> 4) The characters A-na (an-) mean not’, k’ie-mi (agamin) mean returner’ The ascetic thus named has not returning’ as his characteristic Having died in the desire realm (kamadhatu), this man is reborn in the form meditation (bhavanaheya): cf Prakaranapada, T 1541, k 3, p 637a10; T 1542, K 3, p 702a11; Jnanaprasthana, T 1544, k 3, p 930c20-22; Mahavubhasa, T 1545, k 46, p 237c29-238a1; Kosa, V, p 13 77 The Darsanamarga comprises sixteen moments of mind: the first is duhkhe dharmajnanaksanti; the sixteenth and last is the marge nvayajnana (cf Histoire du bouddhisme indien, p 681-682) In the first moment, the sraddhanusarin and the dharmanusarin are candidates for the fruit of srotaapanna (srotaapattiphalapratipannaka); in the sixteenth, they are residents in this fruit (phastha); cf Kosa, VI, p 194-195 78 As soon as he enters into the darsanamarga, the ascetic penetrates into the certainty of the acquisition of the supreme good (samyaktvaniyama); he loses the quality of ordinary person (prthagjana) and takes on that of the saint (arya): cf Kosa, VI, p 181-182 79 Here, in the version of the sutra (T 1509, p 300c22), sakrdagamin has been transliteratedas sseu-t’o-han (the usual transliteration), but the explanations given by the gloss of the Updesa (p 301a2-3) deal with another transliteration, practically unused: si-ki-k’ie-mi This inconsistency undoubtedly escaped Seng-jouei when, according to the translation of the Upadesa, that of the sutra was revised in order make both texts consistent (see Traite, vol III, p XLVII as note) 80 Mahaparinirvana, p 166; Divyavadana, p 533-534: Trayanam samyojananam prahanad ragadvesmohanam ca tanutvat kalam krtva sakrdagami sakrd imam lokam agamya duhkhasyantam karisyati - By the complete destruction of the three fetters (in the course of the darsanamarga) and by the lessening of desire, hatred and delusion (in the course of the bhavanamarga), after his death he becomes a sakrdagamin: having returned only once to this world (the kamadhatu), he will realize the end of suffering Pali wording in Digha, I, p 156;

there his impurities are destroyed (ksinasrava) and he is no longer reborn (na punarbhavati)81 Question - But the anagamin who acquires parinirvana in the present lifetime (drstadharmaparinirvayin) and the anagamin who acquires parinirvana in the intermediary existence (antaraparinirvayin) by going to the rupadhatu, are not reborn either in the form realm or in the formless realm (ruparupyadhatu); then why call them non-returners’ (anagamin)?82 <2217> Answer - Among the anagamins, there are many who are reborn in the form realm or the formless realm, whereas those who are parinirvanized as soon as this present life are rare; as the latter are in the minority, [they keep the name anagamin] which is the name of the majority Those who obtain parinirvana in the intermediate existence (antaraparinirvayin), being also on the point of being reborn in the form realm but 81 Sanskrit Mahaparinirvana, p 166; Divyavadana, p 533, l 24-26: Pancanam avarabhagiyanam samyojananam prahanad aupapadukas tatra aprinirvayy anagamy anavrttidharma punar imam lokam - By the complete destruction of the five lower fetters [namely, satkayadrsti, silavrataparamarsa and vicikitsa which are to be destroyed by seeing (darsanaheya); kamacchanda and vyapada which are to be destroyed by meditation (bhavanaheya): the whole coinciding with the first 92 anusayas,] he is of apparitional birth: It is there [in rupadhatu = Brahmaloka, or more rarely in arupyadhatu] that he will be parinirvanized; as non-returner’, he cannot be reborn in this world [ie, kamadhatu] Pali wording in Digha, I, p 156; II, p 92, 203, 252; III, p 107, 132; Majjhima, I, p 34, 226; Samyutta, V, p 356-357; Anguttara, I, 232; II, p 89, 238: Pancannam orambhagiyanam samyojananam parikkhaya opapatiko hoti tatthaparinibbayi anavattidhammo tasma loka - By the complete destruction of the five lower fetters, he is of apparitional birth and it is there [in rupadhatu = Brahmaloka] that he will be parinirvanized; he cannot come back from that world [the Brahmaloka] to this world [kamadhatu] See the notes of Buddhaghosa in the Commentary of the Majjhima, I, p 164 82 There are several kinds of anagamins: the most widespread list distinguishes five: 1) Antaraparinirvayin who obtains parinirvana in the intermediate existence (yo ntarabhave parinirvati) at the moment when, having left kamadhatu, he is getting ready to attain rupadhatu 2) Upapadyaparinirvayin who, as soon as he is reborn in rupadhatu, obtains parinirvana in a short time (ya utpannamatro na cirat parinirvati) 3) Sabhisamskaraparinirvayin who, having been born, obtains parinirvana without relaxing his effort (upapadyapratiprasrabdhaprayoga) 4) Anabhisamskaraparinirvayin who obtains parinirvana effortlessly 5) Urdhvasrotas who, on leaving kamadhatu, do not obtain parinirvana in the realm in which they are reborn (yasya na tatra parinirvanam yatropapannah), but who go higher (urdhvam) to the Akanistha gods, to the summit of rupadhatu or to bhavagra and find parinirvana there Whether alone or inserted into broader contexts, the list of the five anagamins is very widespread in the sutras and in the Abhidharma, both Sanskrit as well as Pali: Digha, III, p 237 (cf Das Sanghitisutra und sein Kommentar Sangitiparyaya, ed K Mittal und V Rosen, p 153-156); Samyutta, V, p 70, 201, 237, 285, 314, 378; Anguttara, I, p 233, l 28-35; IV, p 14-15; p 70-74 (in the Purisagatisutta of which the Sanskrit correspondent is cited in full in the Kosavyakhya, p 270, l 22-272, ol 3; Chinese version in Madhyama, T 26, k 2, p 427); Samgitiparyaya, T 1536, k 14, p 425c38-427a1; Mahavibhasa, T 1545, k 174, p 874b21-876b14; Amrtarasa, T 1553, K 1, p 973b12-15; Kosabhasya, p 358, l 20-359, l 13 1830seeing the torments they would have to undergo in the course of this last existence (caramabhava), take nirvana all the time; this is why they too take the name of anagamin because it is the name of the majority83 5) Because they have destroyed all the afflictive emotions (klesa), the arhats have the right (arhanti) to the homage (puja) of all the devas, nagas and asuras84 These arhats are of nine types:85 <2218> 1) Parihanadharman, arhat likely to fall 2) Aparihanadharman, arhat not likely to fall 3) Cetanadharman, arhat likely to put an end to his lifetime86 4) Anuraksanadharman, arhat likely to keep his lifetime 5) Sthitakampya, arhat remaining in the fruit without moving 6) Prativedhanadharman, arhat likely to penetrate effortlessly into the Unshakeables 7) Akopyadharman, unshakeable arhat, [incapable of falling] 83 As a general rule, the ascetic who has obtained the fruit of anagamin in kamadhatu is reborn after death in rupadhatu, sometimes even in arupyadhatu, and attains parinirvana there This is the case for the last four types of anagamins mentioned in the preceding note There are, however, two exceptions When the anagamin called antaraparinirvayin (the first type in the preceding note) abandons his existence in kamadhatu to go to rupadhatu, he obtains parinirvana in the intermediate existence (antarabhava) The anagamin called drstadharmaparinirvayin who has obtained the fruit of anagamin in an existence in kamadhatu obtains parinirvana during that same existence without ever going to rupadhatu insofar as his disgust for this sphere of existence is so great (cf Kosa, VI, p 219) Although the antaraparinirvayin and the drstadharmaparinirvayin, in contrast to the other anagamins, do not go to rupadhatu to become parinirvanized there, nevertheless they take the name of anagamin because this is the name of the majority 84 Compare the canonical formula in Digha, I, p 156; II, p 92; Majjhima, I, p 284; Samyutta, II, p 217; Anguttara, I, p 220: Asavanam khaya anasavam cetovimuttim pannavimuttim ditthe va dhamme sayam abhinna sacchikatva upasapajjaviharati - By destruction of the impurities, having realized, in the present existence, by his own knowledge the deliverance of mind and the deliverance by means of wisdom, free of impurities, he abides there 85 Like the Madhyamagama, T 26, k 30, p 616a1-19, the Amrtarasa, T 1553, k 1, p 973b28-c1 the Satyasiddhisastra, T 1646, k 1, p 246b27-29, and the Abhidharmasamuccaya, ed P Pradhan, p 91, l 4-14, the Traite distninguishes nine kinds of arhat or asaiksa (cf p 1392F, 1740F) - But in general, the Sarvastivadin Abhidharmas have only six arhats: Mahavibhasa, T 1545, k 62, p 319c8-9; Abhidharmasara of Dhgarmasri, T 1550, k 2, p 819c8-11; Abhidharmasara of upsanta, T 1551, k 3, p 851a1-2; Samyuktabhidharmasara, T 1552, k 5, p 913c15-18; Kosa, VI, p 251; Nyayanusara, T 1562, k 67, p 710c1-16 Actually, as the Traite has noted, p 1392F, these classifications overlap, the Buddha having expressed himself sometimes at length and sometimes briefly 86 For the meaning of cetanadharman = maranadharman, see Kosa, VI, p 253, n 4 18318) Prajnavimukta, arhat delivered by wisdom 9) Ubhayatobhagavimukta, arhat doubly delivered from the obstacle consisting of the afflictive emotions (klesavarana) and the obstacle opposing the eight liberations (vimoksavarana) For the meaning of these nine types, see above (p 1390-1391F) The eight liberations (vimoksa), the eight masteries (abhibhvayatana), the ten sources of totality (krtsnayatana), the absorption of cessation (nirodhasamapatti), the concentration preventing the arising of another’s afflictive emotions (aranasamadhi), the knowledge resulting from resolution (pranidhijnana), etc, are the marvelous qualities (guna) of the arhat 6) Moreover, he will attain nirvana without residue of conditioning (nirupadhisesanirvana), and this nirupadhisesanirvana is the fact that the arhat [at the moment of his death] rejects the five aggregates (pancaskandhan niksipati) of the present lifetime and then does not take up the five aggregates of the future lifetime (na tu pancapaunarbhavikan skandhan parisamdadhati), and thus his physical and mental sufferings (kayikacaitasikaduhkha) are completely and definitively destroyed About the last three fruits of the Path (margaphala), see what was said in regard to the first Danasya mahaphalani Eight Section PREDICTING THE FRUITS OF RIPENING OF VARIOUS KINDS OF GIFTS Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 25, l 4-17; Satasahasrika, p 80, l 12-92, l 4) - Furthermore, Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva practicing the perfection of wisdom knows what kind of gift should be made in order for it <2219> to be very fruitful - Making the gift in this way, one is reborn in wealthy ksatriya families, in wealthy brahamana families or in wealthy householder families - Making the gift in a certain other way, one is reborn among the Caturmaharajika gods, the Trayastrimsa gods, the Yama gods, the Tusita gods, the Nirmanarati gods or the Paranirmitavasavartin gods - Making the gift in yet another way, one gains the first dhyana, the second dhyana, the third dhyana, the fourth dhyana, the absorption of the sphere of infinite space, the absorption of the sphere of infinite consciousness, the absorption of the sphere of nothing at all or the absorption of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non- perception - By this kind of gift the eightfold noble Path is produced - By a certain other kind of gift, the fruit of entry into the stream and so on up to supreme complete enlightenment is attained (Punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvo mahasattah prajnaparamitayam caran janati yad evam danam dattam mahaphalam bhavat - Evam danam dattva ksatriyamahasalakulesu brahmanamahasalakulesu grhapatimahasalakulesupapadyate - Evam dattva caturmaharajikesu devesu trayastrimsesu devesu yamesu devesu tusitesu devesu nirmanaratisu devesu paranirmitavasavartisu devesupapadyate - Evam 1832danam dattva prathamam dhyanam dvitiyam dhyanam trtiyam dhyanam caturtham dhyanam akasanantyayatanasamapattim vijnanantyayatanasamapattim akimcanyayatanasamapattim naivasamjnanasamjnayatanasamapattim pratilabhate - Evam danam dattva aryastango marga utpadyate - Evam danam dattva srotaapattiphalam yavad anuttara samyaksambodhir anuprapyate) Sastra - The bodhisattva-mahasattva knows the true nature of dharmas (dharmata) free of grasping (aparigraha), free of rejecting (anutsarga) and indestructible (anupaghata) He practices an ungraspable perfection of wisdom (anupalabdha prajnaparamita), but by means of a feeling of great compassion (mahakarunacitta), he returns to cultivate meritorious practices (punyakriya) [301b] The first gate of meritorious practices is above all the practice of generosity (dana) [301b] I WHERE DOES THE EXCELLENCE OF THE GIFT COME FROM? By the sharpness of his wisdom (prajnapatutvat), the bodhisattva who practices the perfection of wisdom is able to make distinctions (paricchid-) between the merits of the gift (danapunya) <2220> 1) While the object given (deyavastu) is the same, the value of the merit (punya) depends on the goodness or the malice of the intention (asaya) of the donor [Gift of a bowl of rice]87 - Thus, one day Sariputra offered a bowl of cooked rice (odana) to the Buddha The Buddha immediately gave it to a dog and asked Sariputra: You have given me some rice and I have given it to a dog Which of the two of us has gained more merit (punya)? - Sariputra answered: If I understand well the meaning of the Lord’s teaching (yatha khalv aham bhagavata bhasitasymartham ajanami),88 by giving it to a dog the Buddha has gained more merit [than me] - Sariputra, the foremost of sages (prajnanatam agryah) amongst all men, made a gift to the Buddha, supreme field of merit (punyaksetram paramam) but did not equal the Buddha who, by offering [the same gift] to this lowly field of merit, a dog, gained very great merit This is how we know that great merit (mahapunya) comes from the intention (asaya) and does not reside in the field’ (ksetra) [in other words, in the beneficiary of the gift] Had Sariputra given a thousand, ten thousand or a hundred thousand times more, he would not have reached [the purity] of intention (asaya) of a Buddha 2) Question - But you yourself have said (p 722F) that the importance of merit is the result of the excellence of the field of merit (buddhaksetrapranitatas), and by making a gift to the Buddha, Sariputra would not have gained great merit 87 Episode mentioned by Akanuma, Dictionnaire des noms propres, p 597a, but not yet identified 88 Cf Sanskrit Mahaparinirvana, p 218 1833Answer - A good field’ also contributes to the importance of merit, but not as much as the intention (asaya) of the donor Why? Because the mind is the internal master (antahsvamin) whereas the field’ is just an outer (bahya) thing Sometimes, however, the merit of generosity (danapunya) resides in the field of merit (punyaksetra) [Avadana of Kotikarna]89 - Thus the arhat Yi-eul (Kotikarna) who once had offered a single flower to a stupa of the Buddha enjoyed happiness among gods and men for ninety-one kalpas; and by virtue of the remainder of his merit (punyasesa), he became an arhat [Pamsupradanavadana]90 - Thus king A-chou-kia (Asoka) <2221> who, as a small child, had given some earth (pamsu) to the Buddha, reigned over Jambudvipa, built eighty thousand stupas and still later, found bodhi The thing he had offered was very common (nica) and the intention (asaya) of the child (baladaraka) quite weak (tanu) It was only because of the excellence of the field of merit (punyaksetrapranitatas) [to which he had given] that he acquired a great fruit of retribution (mahavipakaphala) So we know then that [sometimes] great merit results from the good field’ 3) There are three things present in the highest of the great merits - the intention (asaya) [of the donor], the thing given (deya) and the field of merit (punyaksetra) - [ie, the recipient] - are all three excellent See for example the first chapter (prathama parivarta) of the Prajnapamarita where it is said (cf p 586F) that the Buddha [Sakyamuni] scattered marvelous flowers over the buddhas of the ten directions 4) Finally, in the mind of the Prajnaparamita, the gift free of any attachment (abhinivesa) [in regard to donor (dayaka), the thing given (deya) and the recipient (pratigrahaka)] wins a great fruit of ripening (mahavipakaphala)91 The gift made in view of nirvana also obtains a great retribution92 The gift made 89 Or Avadana of Sumana, mentioned here for the third time;

Anguttara, IV, p 236, l 1-8), but it does appear in the Sanskrit list (Samgitisutra, ed K Mittal and V Rosen, p 188, l 19-27; Samyuktabhidharmasara, T 1552, k 8, p 932b6-8; Kosabhasya, p 270, l 19-22): uttamarthasya praptaye danam dadati -He makes a gift in order to obtain the supreme goal, ie, to obtain arhathood, nirvana (Kosavyakhya, p 435, l 6) Compare the pure gift (visuddham danam), the completely disinterested gift (vipakanapeksam danam), made by the bodhisattva in view of supreme bodhi which the Bodhisattvabhumi, p 135, l 22-25, defines as follows: Na bodhisattvo danam dadad danasyayatyam bhogasampadam atmabhavasampadam va phalavipakam pratyasamsate, sarvasamskaresu phalgudarsi paramabodhav anusamsadarsi - The bodhisattva who gives a gift expects nothing in return for the future, neither the joy of happiness nor his own bliss: in all the formations he sees no significance: it is only in supreme bodhi that he sees benefit Insofar as the way out of all the formations, this unconditioned - nirvana - cannot be a fruit of retribution (vipakaphala) 1834with a feeling of great compassion (mahakarunacitta), to save save all beings (sarvasattvaparitranaya) also obtains a great retribution93 <2222> II DIVERSITY OF THE FRUITS OF GENEROSITY94 93 Cf Kosabhasya, p 270, l 16: Yad va danam bodhisattvo dadati sarvasattvahitahetoh tad amuktasyapy amuktebhyo danam agram - Or else the gift which the bodhisattva makes for the good of all beings: this gift, although given by a non-liberated man to non-liberated people, is the best gift 94 This section is a paraphrase of the Danupapattisutta (Digha, III, p 258-260; Anguttara, IV, p 239-241) dealing with the eight rebirths as a result of generosity Here is the beginning: Idh’ avuso ekacco danam deti samanassa va brahmanassa va annam panam vattham yanam malagandhavilepanam seyyavasasthapadipeyyam So yam deti tam paccasimsati So passati khattiyamahasalam va brahanamahasalam va gahapatimahasalam va pancahi kamagunehi samappitam samangibhutam paricaramanam Tassa evam hoti - Aho vataham kayassa bheda param marana khattiyamahasalanam va brahmanamahasalanam va gahapatimahasalanam va sahavyuatam upapajjeyyan ti’ So tam cittam dahati, tam cittam adhitthati, tam cittam bhaveti Tassa tam cittam hine vimuttam uttarim abhavitam tatr’ upapattiya samvattati Tan ca kho silavato vadami no dussilassa Ijjhat’ avuso silavato cetopanidhi suddhatta Puna ca param avuso idh’ ekacco danam deti samanassa va brahmanasso va annam panam vattham yanam malagandhavilepanam seyyavasathapadipeyyam So yam deti tam paccasimsati Tassa sutam hoti - Catummaharajika deva dighayuka vannavanto sukhabahula ti’ - Aho vataham kayassa bheda param marana Catummaharajikanam devanam sahavyatam upappajjeyyan ti’ So tam cittam dahati, tam cittam adhitthati, tam cittam bhaveti Tassa tam cittam hine vimuttam uttarim abhavitam tatr’ upapattiya samvattati Tan ca kho silavato vadami no dussilassa Ijjhat’ avuso cetopanidhi suddhatta Transl - A certain man, my brothers, makes a gift to a monk or to a brahmana in the form of food, clothing, drink, vehicle, garland, perfume, unguent, bedding, dwelling or lamp For what he gives, he expects something in return He sees a wealthy family of warriors, a wealthy family of brahmanas or a wealthy family of householders provided with the five objects of enjoyment, wealthy and courted Then he thinks: Ah, at the dissolution of my body after death, if I could be reborn among rich families of warriors, rich families of brahmanas or rich families of householders! Having made this thought, he fixes (his attention) on it, he concentrates (his mind) on it and cultivates it This mind, directed to the low and unable to go higher, leads him to be reborn there (where he wished) And this is true, I say, for a moral man and not for a vicious man The mental wish of a moral man derives its success from his purity Furthermore, my brothers, another man makes a gift to a monk or to a brahamana in the form of food, drink, clothing, vehicle, garland, perfume, unguent, bedding, dwelling or lamp He hears it said: The Caturmaharajika gods live for a long time; they are handsome and happy Then he thinks: Ah, at the dissolution of my body after death, if I could be reborn among the Caturmaharajika gods! Having thought thus, he fixes (his attention on it), he concentrates (his mind) on it and cultivates it This mind, directed to the low and unable to rise higher, leads him to be reborn there (where he wished) And that, I say, is true for a moral man and not for a vicious man The mental wish of a moral man derives its success from his purity [Following its explanation, the sutra explains, in the same words, the rebirth of a generous and moral man among the other deities: Trayastrimsa, Yama, Tusita, Nirmanarati, Parinirmitavasavartin and Brahmakayika gods] 1835 In addition to the great fruits of rpening (mahavipakaphala), as is said [here in the Prajnaparamitasutra], it is to be reborn in the families of the ksatriya and so on up to becoming Buddha Question - How does one get to be reborn in the families of the ksatriyas and so on up to becoming Buddha? <2223> Answer - The generous (tyagavat) and moral (silavat) man95 obtains riches and honor among men and gods 1 The seven rebirths in kamadhatu 1) Someone gives with a perfect intention and maintains morality: he is reborn in the families of the ksatriyas The ksatriyas are the kings (rajan) and great ministers (mahamatya) Someone else is attached to books of knowledge (the Vedas?) and does not torment beings: by his generosity and morality, he is reborn in the families of the brahamanas [301c] Another, with generosity and mediocre morality is pleased with worldly happiness (lokasukha): he is reborn in the families of the householders (grhapati) These householders are ordinary people but very wealthy 2) In another, generosity and morality are of somewhat higher purity (visuddhi); this man feels repugnance for domestic things, loves to hear the Dharma and honors worthy people: he is reborn among the Caturmaharajika gods96 Why? Because pleasant97 things appear there as soon as they are thought of (sahacittotpadat pradurbhavanti); one constantly gets to see the good worthy people (satpurusa) of the place, and by honoring them resolutely, one draws near to practicing the meritorious action that consists of meditation (bhavanapunyakriyavastu) 3) Another, of pure generosity and morality, honors his father and mother, reveres them (bhadanta) and passionately seeks supremacy (srestha): he is reborn among the Trayastrimsa gods 4) Another, of pure generosity and morality, who loves to learn and whose mind is gentle, is reborn among the Yama gods 5) Another, of pure generosity and morality, develops these two qualities further; he loves learning (bahusrutya), discriminates the beautiful and the ugly, desires nirvana amd is intensely attached to the qualities (guna): he is reborn among the Tusita gods <2224> 95 In order to do good, the generous man (tyagavat) must also be moral (silavat) and learned (bahusruta) 96 For a precise definition of the six classes of kamadevas, see Kosa, III, p 166 97 Ie, the five objects of enjoyment (pancakamaguna), colors, (rupa), etc 18366) Another, generous, magnanimous, moral and erudite (bahusruta), loves to learn and earns his living by his own strength: he is reborn among the Nirmanarati gods 7) Another, when he gives, shows deepening pure morality; he loves erudition (bahusrutya) and considers himself a spiritual person (sattva); but unable to undergo suffering, he seeks his satisfactions from someone else (para): he is reborn among the Paranirmitavasavartin gods, gods using the desirable objects (kama or kamaguna) created by others in a sovereign manner’98 This is a question of female shapes knowingly and ingeniously created by others (paranirmita); the Paranirmitavasavartin gods take hold of these five objects of enjoyment (pancakamaguna) and use them in a sovereign manner (vase vartayanti) They are like destitute people who fight over a patrimony Finally, it is as a result of a wish (pranidhana) formulated at the moment of the gift that one is reborn in the paradises [Danupapattisutta]99 - Thus it is said in a sutra: A man cultivates a little bit of generosity and morality but is ignorant of the existence of the dhyanas and the absorptions (samapatti) Learning of the existence of the Caturmaharajika gods, he mentally makes them [the object] of his aspirations (cetahpranidhi) The Buddha has said: At the end of his life, this man will be reborn among the Caturmaharajika gods: that is absolutely certain It is the same [in regard to rebirth among the other gods of kamadhatu] up to and including the Paranirmitavasavartin gods 2 Eight rebirths in rupadhatu and arupyadhatu Furthermore, there is a generous and moral man who, while practicing generosity, mentally experiences happiness The greater his gift, the greater his happiness In this state of mind, he rejects the five objects of sensory enjoyment (panca kamaguna), avoids the five obstacles (pancanivarana) and penetrates [into the four dhyanas and the four samapattis], from the first dhyana up to the absorption of neither perception nor non-perception (naivasamjnanasamjna) For these four dhyanas and the four non-material absorptions (arupyasamapatti), see what was said above (p 1027-1034F) <2225> 3 Four rebirths in the noble Path Furthermore, there are people who, having given to the Buddha and his disciples (buddhasravaka), hear from their mouths a sermon on the Path Because of the gifts they have made, their minds (citta) become 98 Digha, III, p 218: Santi satta paranimmitakama, te paranimmitesu kamesu vasam vattenti seyyatha pi deva paranimmitavasavatti 99 Passage cited above, p 2222F, n 1 1837gentle (mrdu), their wisdom (prajna) becomes sharp (tiksna) and they are immediately reborn into the noble eightfold Path (aryastanga marga) By elimination of the three fetters (trayanam samyojananam prahanat), they obtain the fruit of srotaapanna, and so on up to their arrival at the bodhi of the Buddhas As a result of these gifts, they hear [the Buddha] preach the Dharma and then they produce the mind of supreme complete enlightenment (anuttara samyaksambodhi) The generosity of a man not detached from desire (avitaraga) results in rebirth among men, in wealth and honor, or among the six kinds of gods of the desire realm (kamadeva) - The generosity of a man detached from desire (vitaraga) results in rebirth among the gods of the Brahma realm (brahmaloka) , up to the Brhatphalas100 The generosity of a man freed from the notion of material (rupa) [302a] results in a rebirth among the formless gods (arupyadeva) 4 Attainment of the bodhis101 1) The generosity of a man detached from the threefold world (trailokyavirakta), who has nirvana in mind, procures the bodhi of the sravakas 2) If at the moment of giving, the man has a horror of turmoil (samsarga), loves peace (santa) and rejoices in profound wisdom (gambhiraprajna), he attains the bodhi of the pratyekabuddhas 3) If at the moment of giving, the man feels a mind of great pity (mahakarunacitta), wants to save the entire world and realize the highest wisdom (prajna), very deep (atigambhira) and absolutely pure (atyantavisuddha), he attains the bodhi of the Buddhas Satparamitapripuri Ninth Section FULFILLING THE PERFECTIONS SKILLFULLY Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 25, l 18-27, l 2: Satasahasrika, p 91, l 21-93, l 1) - Moreover, Sariputra, when the bodhisattva-mahasattva gives while practicing <2226> the perfection of wisdom, he fulfills completely the perfection of generosity, the perfection of morality, the perfection of patience, the perfection of exertion, the perfection of meditation and the perfection of wisdom - Sariputra said to the Buddha: By what skillful means, O Lord, does the bodhisattva-mahasattva who is making a gift fulfill completely the perfection of generosity, etc, up to the perfection of wisdom? - The Lord replied to Sariputra: By not grasping the giver, the receiver or the thing given, the bodhisattva-mahasattva completely fulfills the 100 The Brhatphalas, in order of greatness, occupy the twelfth place in the Brahmaloka, the third place in the fourth dhyana 101 See above, p 1067-1070F, the passage dedicated to the prajna of the sravakas, of the pratyekabuddhas and of the Buddhas 1838perfection of generosity By not committing either wrong deeds or good actions, the bodhisattva fulfills completely the perfection of morality By not disturbing his mind, the bodhisattva fulfills completely the perfection of patience By not relaxing his physical and mental energy, the bodhisattva fulfills completely the perfection of exertion By having neither distraction nor the act of attention, the bodhisattva fulfills completely the perfection of meditation By understanding all dharmas by means of the method that grasps none of them, the bodhisattva fulfills completely the perfection of wisdom (Punar aparam Sariputra, bodhisattvo mahasattvah prajnaparamitayam caran, danam dadan, upayakausalena danaparamitam silaparamitam ksantiparamitam viryaparamitam dhyanaparamitam prajnaparamitam paripurayati -

The meaning of this paripuri the act of completetly fulfilling’ has been fully explained above102 Now we will speak about upayakausala (or upayakausalya), skillful means103 [In regard to the perfection of generosity], this skillful means is not to grasp (anupalambha) three things: [the donor (dayaka), the thing given (deya) and the recipient (pratigrahaka)] <2227> Question - But in order to realize this non-grasping (anupalambha), skillful means has nothing to eliminate or nothing to do Suppressing the three things, as here, [ie, giver, thing given amd receiver] is to fall necessarily into the view of nihilism (uccheda)104 Answer - There are two kinds of non-graspng (anupalambha): i) not grasping that which exists (upalabdhasyanupalambha); ii) not grasping that which does not exist (anupalabhasyanupa-lambha) Not grasping that which does exist is to fall into the view of nihilism (uccheda) Not grasping that which does not exist is to put skillful means (upayakausala) to work and not falling into the view of nihilism Without skillful means, the donor, [in his gift], clings (udgrhnati) to these three characteristics (nimitta), [ie, the giver, the gift and the receiver] But if he has recourse in the emptiness (sunyata) of these three things, he grasps the absence of characteristics (animitta) He who possesses skillful means from the very beginning (mulata eva) does not see the three characteristics of generosity This is why using skillful means (upayakausala) is not to fall [into the extreme views] of existence and non-existence (bhavavibhavadrsti) 102 The paripuri of the six paramitas is the object of chapters XVII to XXX 103 Here Kumarajiva translates upayakausalya (in Tibetan, thabs la mkhas pa) as houei fang pien, whereas the most frequently used translation is chan k’iao fang pien 104 An extreme view condemned by the Buddha: see above, p 2007-2008F, and Kosa, V, p 40 1839Moreover, eliminating the afflictive emotions (klesasamvartana) on the occasion of a gift is called skillful means Moreover, giving while producing a mind of great compassion toward all beings (mahakarunacitta) is called skillful means The fact of applying (parinamana) the meritorious gifts practiced during numberless past (atita) and future (anagata) lifetimes to supreme and perfect enlightenment (anuttara samyaksambodhi) is also called skillful means [302b] Finally, the fact of commemorating (anusmarana) the merits (punya) acquired by the Buddhas and their disciples (sravaka) in the ten directions (dasadis) and the three times (tryadhvan), the fact of being pleased with their gifts and applying them (parinamana) to supreme and complete enlightenment is also called skillful means105 These are the many potentialities constituting skillful means [in regard to the perfection of generosity] [Mutatis mutandis, it is the same for skillful means in regard to the other five paramitas] including prajnaparamita <2228> Buddhagunanuprapana Tenth Section ATTAINING THE QUALITIES OF ALL THE BUDDHAS Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 29, l 4-5; Satasahasrika, p 93, l 1-3) - Furthermore, Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to attain the qualities of the blessed Buddhas, past, future and present, must practice the perfection of wisdom (Punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvena mahasattvenatitanagatapratyutpannanam buddhanam bhagavatam gunam anupraptukamena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Question - The qualities of the past Buddhas have already disappeared; the qualities of the future Buddhas do not yet exist, and the qualities of the present Buddhas are not perceptible (nopalabhyante): therefore the qualities of the Buddhas of the three times (tryadhvan) do not exist Then why does the Prajnaparamitasutra speak here of the bodhisattva who, wishing to acquire the qualities of the Buddhas of the three times, should practice the perfection of wisdom? Answer - The sutra does not speak of the bodhisattva wanting to acquire the qualities of all the Buddhas of the three times, but of the bodhisattva wanting to acquire for himself qualities that are not fewer than those 105 See chapter XLIV 1840of one Buddha of the three times How is that? In all the Buddhas, the qualities are [numerically] equal, neither more nor less numerous106 Question - If that is true, how can one say in regard to the buddha Amita that his lifespan (ayuspramana) is limitless (aparimita), that his brilliance (prabha) covers thousands of myriads of kotis of yojanas107 and that he has saved beings of innumerable kalpas? Answer - The buddhafields (buddhaksetra) are diverse (nanavidha): <2229> there are those that are pure (parisuddha), those that are impure (aparisuddha) and those that are mixed (misra)108 [Trayastrimsesu devesu buddharohanaparivarta]109 - Thus it is said in the San-che-san-t’ien-p’in sutra (Trayastrimsadevaparivarta): At that time, the Buddha had gone to spend the rainy season among the Trayastrimsa gods (tatra khalu varsavasam bhagavan upagatas trayastrimsesu devesu), and when the time of dismissal [pravarana] had come (atha tadaiva pravaranayam pratyurpasthitayam),110 the four assemblies (catasrah parsadah) remaining on earth and not having seen the Buddha for a long time, were distressed and sad They sent Mou-lien (Maudgalyayana) [to the Buddha} and Maudgalyayana said to the Buddha: Lord, why do you neglect all these people and stay with the gods? Then the Buddha said to Maudgalyayana: Look at this universe with its three thousand continents (trisahasra lokadhatu) By the power of the Buddha, Maudgalyayana looked at the universe in question and he saw there some Buddhas who were preaching the Dharma to the great assembly, other Buddhas seated 106 The qualities or attributes of the Buddhas have been the subject of chapters XXXIX to XLII: they are the same in all the Buddhas, but the latter differ in certain points The Kosabhasya, p 415, l 14-17, comments: Tribih karanaih samyam sarvabuddhananam / sarvapunyajnanasambhara-samudagamatah dharmakayaparinispattitah arthacaryaya ca lokasya / ayurjatigotrapramanakrtas tu bheda bhavati / - All the Buddhas are alike in three aspects: in that they have accumulated the entire accumulation of merit and wisdom; in that they realize the same dharmakaya; in that they give the same service to beings But they differ in their lifespan, in caste, in clan and in the size of their body 107 Small Sukhavativyuha, ed U Wogihara, 1931, p 200 §8-9 (T 366, p 347a25-29): Tat kim manyase sariputra kena karanena sa tathagato mitayur namocyate / tasya khalu punah sariputra tathagatasya tesam ca manusyanam aparimitam ayuhpramanam / tena karanena sa tathagato mitayur namocyate / tasya ca sariputra tathagatasya dasa kalpa anuttaram samyaksambodhim abhisambuddhasya // tat kim manyase sariputra kena karanena sa tathagato mitabho namocyate / tasye khalu punah sariputra tathagatasyabhapratithata sarvabuddhaksetresu / 108 See below (k 93, p 711c18) and Yogacarabhumi, T 1579, k 79, p 736c21 109 T 815, k 3, p 795b20-c27; T 816, k 3, p 811b22-812a2 - A Mahayanasutra relating the ascent of the Buddha to the Trayastrimsa heaven to preach the Dharma there to his mother; this is an episode of the Miracle of Samkasya which has been mentioned above (p 634-635F, 1765-1767F, n) This sutra is known by two Chinese translations: 1) Fo cheng t’ao li t’ien wei mou chouo fa king (T815), also called Fo cheng t’ao li t’ien p’in king, the title used here by the Traite This translation was made by Dharmaraksa at Tch’ang-ngan during the first year of the T’ai- che pperiod (265-266) Cf Li, T 2034, k 6, p 62c16-17; K’ai, T 2154, k 2, p 494a19-20 2) Tao chen tsou wou ki pien houa king (T816), also called Tao chen tsou king This translation was made by the Parthian sramana Ngan Fa-kin who worked at Lo-yang from 281 to 306 110 Cf Divyavadana, p 91, l 12-13 1841in meditation, yet others begging their food; in these many ways they were accomplishing their Buddha- work (buddhakarya) Then Maudgalyayana prostrated with a fivefold bow (pancangapranama);111 Sumeru, king of the mountains, shook with great trembling and all the gods were seized by great fear Maudgalayayana burst into tears and bowing his head, said to the Buddha: In their great compassion (mahakaruna) the Buddhas do not abandon anyone: by working with these many transformations (nirmana), they save beings <2230> The Buddha said to Maudgalyayana: What you see is nothing at all Beyond what you see, in the east (purvasyam disi) there is a universe the ground of which is made only of gold (suvarnamaya): the disciples of the Buddha who lives there are all arhats and their six superknowledges (abhijna) are without obstacle - Beyond that region of the east, there is a universe the ground of which is made only of silver (rupyamaya): the disciples of the Buddha there all practice (siksante) the bodhi of the pratyekabuddhas - Beyond this region of the east there is a universe the ground of which is made only of the seven jewels [302c] (saptaratna); on that ground there is always an immense brilliance (apramanaprabha): the disciples created there by the Buddha are all bodhisattvas who have all attained the gates of dharani and samadhi and abide in the non-regressing stage (avaivartukabhumi) You should know, O Maudgalyayana, that all those Buddhas are myself Thus, among all these numberless universes (lokadhatu) in the eastern direction, equal in number to the sands of the Ganges (ganganadivalukopama), there are some that are beautiful (subha) and some that are ugly (asubha): in all of them, it is I myself who carry out the work of Buddha And it is the same in the universe of the south (daksinasyam disi), of the west (pascimayam disi), and the north (uttarasyam disi), in the four intermediate directions (catasrsu vikisu), in the direction of the zenith (uparistad disi) and in the direction of the nadir (adhastad disi) - This is why it should be known that the Buddha Sakyamuni has pure universes (parisuddhalokdhatu) also, like [the Sukhavati] of Amita, and that the buddha Amita, as well as his pure universes, has also impure universes (aparisuddha), like [the Sahaloka] of Buddha Sakyamuni The great compassion (mahakaruna) of the Buddhas penetrates as far as the marrow of their bones’ (asthimajjam ahatya tisthati):112 Indifferent to the beauty or the ugliness of the universes, they conform (anuvartante) [to the needs] of the beings to be saved and train them (vinayanti), like a tender loving mother trains her son: should he fall into a pit of excrement, she rushes to pull him out without any regard for the annoyance Raising with a single hair (ekena valena) the hundred kotis of Sumerus in the Trisahasramahasmahasralokadhatu already is difficult 111 A bow made with arms, knees, head, chest (vaksas) and gaze: see Monier-Willimas, p 578a 112 A time-honored expression: a violent passion like the love of parents for their son (putrapreman), cuts in turn the skin (chavi), the hide (carman), the flesh (mamsa), the muscles (snayu), the bone (asthi) and having cut the bone, penetrates into the marrow and stays there’ In Pali, atthim chetva atuthiminjam ahacca titthati: cf Vin I, p 83, l 4; Samyutta, II, p 238, l 16; Anguttara, IV, p 129, l 15 1842CHAPTER L: ARRIVING AT THE OTHER SHORE Purvaagama First Section ARRIVING AT THE OTHER SHORE Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 29, l 5-6; Satasahasrika, p 93, l 5-5) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to arrive at the other shore of conditioned and unconditioned dharmas must practice the perfection of wisdom (Punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvena mahasattvena samskrtasamskrthanam dharmanam param gantukamena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Arriving at the other shore’ is coming precisely to the other shore (anta) of conditioned (samskrta) dharmas and unconditioned (asamskrta) dharmas By means of great wisdom, how does one get to know entirely, to exhaust entirely, (mahaprajna), this other shore’ (para)? By analyzing the general characteristics (samanyalaksana) and the specific characteristics (svalaksana) of conditioned dharmas in many ways, and, in regard to the unconditioned dharmas, by understanding completely [the four fruits of the religious life] (sramanyaphala) from srotaapanna up to Buddhahood113 For the characteristics of conditioned and unconditioned dharmas, see what has been said above (p 2077F) Second Section UNDERSTANDING TATHATA, DHARMATA AND ANUTPADAKOTI Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 29, l 6-8; Satasaharika, p 94, l 13-19) - The bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection <2232> of wisdom if he wishes to understand all dharmas, past, present and future, their dharma-nature and their intrinsic non-arising (Bodhisattvena mahasattvena sarvadharmanam atitanagatapratyutpannanam tathatam dharmanam anutpadakotim anuboddhukamena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) 113 According to the Sarvastivadins, the fruits of the religious life (sramanyaphala) are conditioned (samskrta) and unconditioned (asamskrta) The eighty-nine paths of abandoning (prahanamarga), or paths of immediate succession (anantaryamarga), by means of which the ascetic abandons the afflictive emotions of the threefold world, make up the religious life (sramanya) The eighty-nine paths of deliverance (vimuktimarga) by means of which the ascetic takes possession of the abandonment are the conditioned fruits of the sramanya, being nisyandaphala and purusakaraphala of the sramanya See Kosa, VI, p 241-242; Kosabhasya, p 369-370 1843Sastra - Question - Above (p 2186F), tathata, the manner of existence’, has already been spoken of; why talk about it again here? Answer - Above, we talked simply of the tathata of all dharmas; here we are speaking about the tathata of the three times (tryadhvan) - Above, we spoke briefly (samksepena); here we will speak at length (vistarena) - Above, we spoke of just [the tathata];114 here we are speaking of three things [tathata, dharmata and anutpadakoti] The dharmata dharma-nature’ is the dharmadhatu fundamental [303a] element’; the anutpadakoti intrinsic non-arising’ is the bhutakoti limit of truth’ The tathata of past (atita) dharmas is the dharmata of past dharmas, and it is the same for future (anagata) and present (pratyutpanna) dharmas Furthermore, the tathata of past dharmas is the tathata of future and present dharmas; the tathata of present dharmas is the tathata of past and present dharmas Why? Because the nature of tathata is beyond identity (ekatva) and diversity (nanatva) Furthermore, as I have said above (p 2196F), there are two kinds of tathata: the worldly (laukiki) tathata and the supraworldly (lokottara) tathata In terms of the worldly tathata, the three times are each different; in terms of the supraworldly tathata, the three times are the same As for the dharmata, there are action-dharmas (karman) and result-dharmas (krta), causes-conditions (hetupratyaya) and fruits of retribution (vipakaphala), in the same way that fire (tejas) has heat (usnatva) as its nature and water (ap-) has moistness (dravatva) as its nature The causes-conditions and the fruits of retribution of these dharmas are distinguished Each has its specific nature <2233> (svalaksana) as has been said (p 1524-1527F) in regard to the power [of knowledge] concerning the possible and the impossible (sthanasthanajnanabala): that is the worldly (laukiki) dharmata - But if one examines and considers the nature of things, one enters into the system of non-arising (anutpada) and one does not depart from it: this is called anutpadakoti intrinsic non-arising’ Objection [of the Sarvastivadin] - But in this dharmata it is possible to discern the existence of the three times The anutpadakoti is future (anagata) dharmas How is there still the past (atita) and the present (pratyutpanna)? The Abhidharma gives the answer: Dharmas having-arising (utpattika) are the past and the present; dharmas without-arising (anutpattika) are the future and unconditioned (asamskrta) dharmas That being so, why would you want the past and the present to be without-arising? Answer - In many ways previously I have refuted the existence of dharma-having-birth: all dharmas are unborn (anutpannah sarvadharmah) Why would the future be the only one to be without-birth? Above (p 76-79F), in interpreting the phrase at one time, I refuted the existence of the three times (tryadvan) The 114 Above, it was a matter of the tathata, the dharmadhatu and the bhutakoti, but it was to identify all three with nirvana 1844three times have only one characteristic, namely, the absence of nature (ekalaksanam yadutalaksanam); that is their nature of non-arising (anutpadalaksana) Moreover, the anutpada is called nirvana because nirvana does not arise and does not cease From beginning to end, nirvana is absolutely without rebirth (apaunarbhavika) and all dharmas are nirvana This is why the Buddha speaks here of their anutpadakoti, their intrinsic non-arising’ Purvamgamana Third Section ACQUIRING PRECEDENCE, ETC Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 29, l 9-14; SatasMahasrika, p 94, l 19-95, l 9) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wants to acquire precedence over all the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, become the assistant of all the blessed Buddhas, participate in the close circle of all the blessed Buddhas, have a large following, acquire a following of bodhisattvas and purify great offerings (Punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvena mahasattvena sarvasravakapratyekabuddhanam purvamgamena bhavitukamena, buddhanam bhagavatam upasthayakena bhavitukamena, buddhanam bhagavatam abhyantaraparivarena bhavitukamena, <2234> mahaparivarena bhavitukamena, bodhisattvaparivaram pratilabdhukamena, daksinam parisodhayatukamena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - I ACQUIRING PRECEDENCE OVER THE SRAVAKAS AND PRATYEKABUDDHAS Question - How can the bodhisattva who has not yet acquired the cessation of the impurities (asravaksaya) take precedence over the holy individuals (aryapudgala) whose impurities are destroyed (ksinasarava)? Answer - From his first production of the mind of bodhi (prathamacittotpada), the bodhisattva already takes precedence over all beings; what more can be said (kah punarvadah) when he has practiced (carya) for many kalpas? The merits (punya) and knowledge (jnana) of this bodhisattva are great; from lifetime to lifetime he has always been of great benefit to the sravakas and [303b] pratyekabuddhas Out of recognition of the benefits (krtajnata) of the bodhisattva, beings venerate him, esteem him and respect him even in his [earlier] animal existences115 115 According to the Pali sources, the bodhisattva, in his earlier lifetimes, was an antelope, buffalo, bull, cock, crow, elephant, dog, lizard, duck, frog, garuḍa, goose, hare, horse, iguana, jackal, lion, lizard, monkey, parrot, partridge, 1845[Rurujataka]116 - Thus, at one time the Bodhisattva was a deer (mrga), his body golden in color (suvarnvarna), his antlers (visana) made of the seven jewels (saptaratnamaya), and five hundred deer followed him as his servants When the Bodhisattva lived [as a lay person] among men, he was, during the fortunate periods, a noble cakravartin king; but in <2235> periods of corruption (kasayakala), he was a great king protecting the Buddhadharma and benefiting beings117 When the Bodhisattva left home (pravrajita) [to embrace the religious life], if the Dharma of a Buddha existed at that time, he was a great savior-teacher for the world; but if, [at that time], the Dharma of a Buddha did not exist, he was a great heretic teacher (tirthika mahacarya) practicing the four immeasurables (apramana)118 Although they are without impurities (anasrava), the arhats and pratyekabuddhas render only mediocre service: they are like a bushel of melted butter (ghrta) which, although shiny, is only the foam (phena) of the great ocean The bodhisattva himself, despite his impure wisdom (sasravaprajna) and his maturations (paripaka) renders immense service (apramananugraha) peacock, pigeon, quail, rat, deer, snake, vulture, wood-pecker, many times over (see General Index of Jataka Stories, ed E B Cowell, vol V-VI, sv Bodhisattva) Many animal existences are also noted in Cinq cents Contes et Apologues extraits du Tripitaka chinois by E Chavannes; they are noted in Hobogirin, IV, p 317, sv Chikushß 116 Pali Jataka, no 482, p 255-263 (transl Jataka Stories, IV, p 161-166); Lieou tou tsi king, T 152, no 58, k 6, p 33a6-b23 (transl Chavannes, Contes, I, p 220-224);

Ajanta, cave II; Boro-Budur (Leemans, pl CLXIX) 117 Human existences of the Bodhisattva as a lay-person: during the fortunate periods (bhadrakalpa) characterized by the appearance of Buddhas, he was a cakravartin king; during the periods of corruption (kasayakala), he was a king The Pali Jataka mentions no less than forty-eight lifetimes during which the Bodhisattva was a king ruling by the Dharma; see, eg, the Vatamigajataka, I, p 159, l 11-12, the Mahasilavajataka, I, p 268; the Ucchangajataka, I, p 308, l 22 The five corruptions (kasaya) affect lifespan (ayus), beings (sattva), the afflictive emotions (klesa), wrong views (drsti) and the period (kalpa) See the notes of L de La Vallee Poussin in Kosa, III, p 193, 207 118 Human existences of the Bodhisattva as a monk: if the Holy Dharma exists in the world, he is a model monk; if the Holy Dharma is not present, he is a great heretic teacher of high moral standards Here the Traite has in mind the heretic Sunetra who practiced the four brahmaviharas, loving-kindness, etc, splendidly, and with whom Sakyamuni is identified in some versions of the Saptasuryopamasutra: see above, p 520F, 2091-2092F and notes; also the Mahakarma-vibhanga, p 37 1846Finally, in regard to the four kinds of purifications (caturvidhapariskara) that are the auxiliaries to enlightenment (bodhipaksya),119 the arhats and pratyekabuddhas have received a great deal from the bodhisattva [Suramgamasamadhisutra]120 - Thus it is said in the <2236> Cheou-leng-king (Suramgamasutra), Manjusri was a pratyekabuddjha 7,200,000 times and by converting people to the pratyekabuddha Vehicle, he helped them realize bodhi This is why the bodhisattva has precedence over the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas II BEING THE ASSISTANT OF THE BUDDHA The bodhisattva wants to be the assistant (upasthayaka) of the Buddhas’ 1) Thus, when Sakyamuni had not yet left home (anabhiniskranta), he had Tch’e-ni (Chandaka) as helper (upasthayaka), Yeou-t’o-ye as play-mate (ahakridanaka),121 Kiu-p’i-ye (Gopiya), Ye-chou-t’o (Yasodhara) and other women of the harem (antahpura) as his intimate entourage (abhyantaraparivara)122 2) After he left home (abhiniskranta), during the six years in which he practiced asceticism (duskaracarya), he had the pancakas as assistants (upasthayaka)123 119 The arhats and pratyekabuddhas are indebted to the bodhisattva for material benefits - clothing, food, furniture and medicines - and above all for spiritual benefits, teaching the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment which were the subject of chapter XXXI The material benefits are known under the name of Caturvidha pujapariskara detailed in the formula: civara- pinḍapata-sayanasana-glanapratyayabhaisajya-pariskara: cf Vinaya, III, P 132, l 8-9; Digha, III, p 268, l 1; Samyutta, IV, p 288, l 12: 291, l 5; Mahavastu, I, p 49, l 10; Avadanasataka, I, p 1, l 7; Divya, p 143, l 6,, etc 120 Passage from the Suramgamasamadhi, French transl, p 245, §147, already cited above, p 602F and 1907F Later, the Traite (k 75, p 586a28) will explain that Manjusri often simulated the nirvana of the pratyekabuddhas because at his time beings could be converted only by pratyekabuddhas 121 Cf Mahavastu,III, p 91, l 7-9: Ayam tava Chandaka sa yeva Bhagavato kumarabhutasya upasthayako etena sardham kumaro abhiniskranto, ayam pi Udayi purohitaputro Bhagavto kumarabhutasya darakavayasyo abhusi sahapamsukriḍanako - Jataka, I, p 86, l 14-15: So (Kaludayi) kira ranno sabbatthasadhako abbhantariko ativissasiko Bodhisattena saddhim ekadivase jato sahapamsukiḷito sahayo 122 Like most other sources, the Traite acknowledges only two legitimate wives to Sakyamuni: Gopiya who was sterile and Yasodhara, mother of Rahula For the women of the Buddha before his Great Departure, see above, p 1001F foll For Gopa or Gopiya, whose sex has been debated, see Suramgamasamadhi, French transl, p 172-173note 123 During the six years between his Great Departure (abhiniskramana) and his enlightenment (abhisambodhana), Sakyamuni had as assistants the Wou jen Five men’, two characters often used by the Chinese translators to render the Sanskrit expression Pancakabhadravargiyah (Lalita, p 245, l 16; Mahavastu, II, p 241, l 2) These are the five individuals of good family’ who helped the Bodhisattva during his six years of austerities, abandoned him when he 18473) After his enlightenment, Mi-hi (Meghiya), Lo-t’o (Radha), Siu-na-tch’a-to-lo (Sunaksatra), A-nan (Ananda), Mi-tsi-li-che (Guhyaka Malla), etc, formed his close entourage (abhyantaraparivara)124 <2237> renounced his mortifications, heard the great Sermon at Benares and became, after Sakyamuni, the first five arhats in the world (Catusparisad, p 170) Their names are Ajnatakaunḍinya, Asvajit, Vaspa, Mahanaman and Bhadrika 124 Many were the upasthayakas who assisted the Buddha Sakyamuni during his public life: five according to the Traite, p 1675F; seven according to the Commentary of the Theragatha (Psalms of the Brethren, p, 350) and the Commentary of the Udana, p 217; eight according to the Vinayamatrka, T 1463, k 5, p 827c12-14; see above, p 1675-75F note The bodhisattva Guhyaka Vajrapani does not appear in this list If the Traite thinks it proper to add him here, it is clearly in reference to the section of the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya in which the journey into the north-west of India made by the Buddha accompanied by Ananda and Vajrapani Above (p 547F), the Traite alluded to this voyage and, with the help of the Tibetan and Chinese sources, the only ones available to me (Lamotte), I tried (p 548-554F) to retrace the grand stages Since then, the 1948 publication, with the careful clarifications of N Dutt, of many Sanskrit pages relating to this episode (Gilgit Manuscripts, III, part I, p XVII to XVIII, and l 17, 1948), I have been able to retrace more precisely the itinerary followed by the Buddha and his companions (cf Alexandre et le Bouddhisme, BEFEO, XLIV, 1951, p 52-158) The subject has been entirely revived by the two monumental studies of G Tucci dedicated to Swat: Preliminary Reports on the Italian Excavations in Swat (Pakistan), in East and West, IX, 1958, p 279-328 (see especially the notes appearing on pages 326-328 (see also pages 61 to 64) These studies, where the great Italian master uses all his talents, abound in details of topography, geography, ethnology and literary history, politics, monastics of the north-west of India They show the importance of the Dardes in the elaboration and transmission of the voluminous and complete Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya In the course of his journey in the north-west, the Buddha used three itineraries: i) an itinerary in six stages, from Hastinapura to Rohitaka; ii) an itinerary in 17 stages starting from Tamasavana and retrunbing to Rohitala; iii) an itinerary linking Rohitaka and Mathura In the first and the third, he was assisted by Ananda; in the second, he was accompanied by Vajrapani This explains why the Traite here includes VajrapanI in the close entourage (abhyantaraparivara) of the Buddha But at this time, Vajrapani was merely a simple protector demon occasionally mentioned in the canonical sources; he was still engaged, especially in the north-west of India, in this process of becoming sublimated which transformed him successively into a beneficent spirit, into a bodhisattva, into a god and, finally, even into the supreme being (see Vajrapani en Inde, in Melanges de Sinologie offerts à Paul Demieville, I, 1966, p 113-159) In harmony with a very widespread Mahayanist belief, the Traite considers Guhyaka VajrapanI to be a bodhisattva prevailing over all the bodhisattvas, all the more so over humans (p 615F) and already in possession of bodhi (k 39, p 344a28-29) The role played by Vajrapani in the Buddha’s service does not eclipse that of Ananda, the devoted disciple The latter kept his official title of upasthayaka and fulfilled his mission conscientiously during the last twenty-five years of the master’s life The Mahayanists have never contested the foremost position that Ananda occupied at the Council of Rajagrha where he recited the sutras of the Tripitaka They further wanted to include Ananda with the great bodhisattvas such as Manjusri, Maitreya, Vajrapani, to compile the scriptures of the Mahayana (cf p 939-942F, n) They know that a large number of Mahayana sutras were entrusted by the Buddha himself to the care of Ananda as well as entrusting the dedications (parindana) with which they end At the time when the Traite was composed, the grand figures of Ananda and the bodhisattva Vajrapani were closely linked and mutually complemented each other In the 1848 III ACQUIRING A GREAT ENTOURAGE The bodhisattva wishes to acquire a great entourage (mahaparivara) Holy individuals (aryapudgala) such as Cho-li-fou (Sariputra), <2238> Mou-k’ien-lien (Maudgalyayana), Mo-ho-kia-chö (Mahakasyapa), Siu- p’ou-t’i (Subhuti), Kia-tchan-yen (Katyayana), Fou-leou-na (Purna),125 A-ni-lou-teou (Aniruddha), etc, and also the non-regressing bodhisattvas (avaivartika), separated from buddhahood by only one lifetime (ekajatipratibaddha), such as Mi-lo (Maitreya), Wen-chou-che-li (Manjusri), P’o-t’o-p’o-lo (Bhadrapala), are called the great entourage (mahaparivara) of Sakyamuni126 Furthermore, the Buddha has two kinds of bodies: i) a body born of the fundamental element (dharmadhatujakaya); ii) a body in accord with the world (lokanuvartakakaya)127 The worldly body (laukikakaya) had the already-mentioned entourage As for the body born of the fundamental element, it had as assistants (upasthayakaya) innumerable (aprameya) and incalculable (asamkhyeya) bodhisattvas separated from buddhahood by only one single existence (ekajatipratibaddha) Why? [Ganḍavyuhasutra] - It is said in the Pou-k’o-sseu-yi-kiai-t’o king (Acintyavimoksasutra)128 that when he was born, the Buddha was the head of 84-000 bodhisattvas separated from buddhahood by only one existence (ekajatipratibaddha) and that these bodhisattvas were born in his entourage like dark clouds encircling the moon close entourage of the Buddha, the former represents the Hinayana or rather the early Buddhism; the latter embodies the Mahayana, but both are in the service of the Buddha and his Dharma 125 Purna-maitrayaniputra 126 This is indeed a mixed (misra) entourage consisting of sravakas and bodhisattvas In bygone days long past, Bhadrapala at the head of five hundred monks had insulted the bodhisattva Sadaparibhuta who was none other than Sakyamuni in one of his earlier rebirths As a result of this offense, he had to undergo incalculable periods of terrible punishments He was converted by hearing the Lotus sutra and became an irreversible bodhisattva (cf Saddharmapunḍ, chap XIX, p 375-384) He appears at the head of the twenty-two major bodhisattvas who were present at the preaching of the Prajnaparamita; he was then an old man of the Vaisya caste and lived in Rajagrha (see above, p 428-429F) He plays a principal part in the Pratyutpannasamadhisutra, also entitled Bhadrapalasutra As the Traite has related above (p 425-426F), it was he who explained the subjectivity and emptiness of dharmas to the three brothers who, in dreams, had had sexual relations with the courtesans Amrapali, Sumana and Utpalavarna (cf T 416, k 1, p 876a; T 417, p 899a; T 418, k 1, p 905a-b; T 419, p 922a-b, as well as the comments of P Demieville, La Yogacarabhumi de Samgharaksa, BEFEO, XLIV (1954), p 355 and 431) 127 A body already noted, p 1780-1781F, 1805F, 1818F, 1908F 128 The Traite refers to the Ganḍavyuha sometimes under the title Pou-k’o-sseu-yi king = Acintyasutra (Chinese transl, p 94b, 317a, 419a), sometimes under that of Pou-k’o-sseu-yi kiai-t’o king = Acintyavimoksasutra (transl p 303b, 308b, 576c, 754b, 756b) 1849[Saddharmapunḍarikasutra]129 - It is said in the Fa-houa king <2239> (Punḍarikasutra) that the bodhisattvas who arose from the earth each had a close entourage (abhyantaraparivara), a great entourage (mahaparivara) <2240> IV ACQUIRING A BODHISATTVA ENTOURAGE The bodhisattva wishes to acquire a bodhisattva entourage’ (parivara) There are Buddhas who are surrounded only by bodhisattvas; there are Buddhas who are surrounded only by sravakas; there are Buddhas who are [303c] surrounded by both bodhisattvas and sravakas This is why the Prajnaparamitasutra says here that, in order to acquire an entourage composed exclusively of bodhisattvas, the bodhisattva must practice the Prajnaparamita 129 Saddharmapunḍarika, beginning of chapter XIV, Bodhisattvaprthivivivarasamudgama, p 297-298, of which, the translation by Burnouf follows: [This passage does not appear in the Gilgit manuscripts, ed S Watanabe, chap XIV, Bodhisattvaprthivisamudgamana, the first pages of which have not been found] - Atha khalv anyalokadhatvagatanam bodhisattvanam mahasattvanam astau Ganganadivalukasama bodhisattva mahasattvas tasmin samaya tatah parsanmanḍalad  ya itah Sahaya lokadhator dharanivivvarebhyah samunmajjante sma/ Transl - Then bodhisattva-mahasattvas, as numerous as the sands of eight Ganges, making up a part of those bodhisattvas who had come from other universes, arose in that moment in the midst of the assembly Joining their palms together in respect, facing the Bhagavat and having worshipped him, they addressed him thus: If the Bhagavat will allow us, we too would explain this teaching of the Dharma in the Saha universe when the Tathagata has entered complete nirvana May we be able to teach it, worship it, write it! May we be able to dedicate our efforts to this teaching of the Dharma! May the Bhagavat grant us also this teaching of the Dharma! Then the Bhagavat said to these bodhisattvas: What is the use, O sons of good family, of making you responsible for this duty? In this Saha universe, I have millions of bodhisattvas, in number equal to the sands of sixty Ganges, who serve as the retinue of one single bodhisattva Now there are millions of bodhisattvas of this latter kind, in number equal to that of the sands of sixty Ganges, who, when I have entered full nirvana at the end of time, in the last period, will have this explanation of the Dharma, who will preach it, who will explain it Hardly had the Bhagavat pronounced these words than the Saha universe split open on all sides, was covered with cracks, and in the middle of these cracks there appeared hundreds of thousands of myriads of koti of bodhisattvas whose bodies were golden in color, endowed with the thirty-two signs marking the Great Man, who, having been under this great earth in the space situated below, came into the Saha universe; indeed, as soon as they had heard the words pronounced by the Bhagavat, they issued from the bosom of the earth Each of these bodhisattvas had a retinue of millions of bodhisattvas, in number equal to that of the sands of sixty Ganges, forming behind them a troop, a huge troop of which he was the preceptor These bodhisattva-mahasattvas, followed thus by these troops, these huge troops, troops of which they were the preceptors and which were seen in hundreds of thousands of myriads of koti in number equal to that of the sands of sixty Ganges, had come together from the cracks in the eart to appear in this Saha universe 1850There are three kinds of entourage (parivara): superior, middling and inferior The inferior one is made up of sravakas alone; the middling one is a mixture [of sravakas and bodhisattvas]; the superior one consists only of bodhisattvas V PURIFYING GREAT OFFERINGS The bodhisattva wishes to purify great offerings (daksina)’130 Some say: The bodhisattva collects much merit (punya) but does not eliminate his afflictive emotions (klesa); [that is why], by accepting the pious offerings (daksina) of people, he does not purify them (na parisodhayati) - But the Buddha has said that for the bodhisattva <2241> who is practicing the perfection of wisdom, all dharmas are empty (sunya) and non-existent (anupalbdha) and all the more so the fetters (samyojana) Once having entered into the fundamental element (dharmadhatu), the bodhisattva does not realize the limit of the truth (bhutakotim na saksatkaroti): this is why he is able to purify the gifts [made to him] Furthermore, the bodhisattva has very great (vipula) merits: from the first production of the mind of bodhi (prathamacittotpada) he wants to take the place of each being in particular to undergo all the sufferings [in that being’s place] He wants to give all his merits to all beings and only after that to find the bodhi of the Buddhas (abhisambodhi) for himself But not being able to realize such a task alone, he will end up becoming Buddha and saving all beings Furthermore, the altruistic wishes (pranidhana) of the bodhisattva are beyond calculation (asamkhyeya) As the world of beings (loka), the tathata, the dharmadhatu, the bhutakoti, the akasa, etc, last for a long time (cirasthitika), so the intention of the bodhisattva to remain in the world for the benefit of beings (sattvanam 130 Kumarajiva translates parisodhayitum by the characters tsing-pao purifying-rewarding’ The bodhisattva purifies the offerings made to him by accepting them and consuming them: thus he increases the merit (punya) of the donor The merit of the gift is of two kinds: i) the merit produced by abandonment (tyaganvaya), merit resulting from the mere fact of abandoning; ii) the merit produced by enjoyment (paribhoganvaya), merit resulting from the enjoyment by the person who receives, of the object given (cf Kosabhasya, p 272, l 5-6: Dvividham hi punyam tyaganvayam tyagad eva yad upapadyate, paribhoganvayam ca deyadharmaparibhogad yad utpadyate) For reasons explained in the Pali Vinaya, II, p 125, and Anguttara, IV, p 344-345, the saagha may avoid or refuse the offerings of a layperson and turn the begging-bowl upside down’ (pattam nikkujjati) Such a refusal, although it does not entirely destroy the merit of the gift, does not purify’ it: a gift made remains made (krta), but if the beneficiary does not accept it and does not consume it, it is not ’accumulated’ (upacita) Accepting a gift is to purify’ it (parisodhana) and increase the merit of the donor The bodhisattva wants to accept the great offerings (daksina) made to him not out of personal interest but to increase the merit of his benefactors 1851hitaya) is of long duration as well and knows no limits (paryanta):131 If such a man cannot purify the merits of the offerings [made to him], who then can? A father and a mother, however heavy their fetters (samyojana), dedicate their entire lives so that their son may be very fortunate; how then could the bodhisattva, who has no fetters and who for an infinite number of lifetimes dedicates himself (anantajanmasu) to the welfare of beings, be unable to purify the offerings? Finally, if a bodhisattva endowed only with compassion (karunacitta) but without wisdom (prajna) is already so beneficial, what can be said of the bodhisattva cultivating the perfection of wisdom? Question - But how can the bodhisattva who has no more fetters still take on rebirths in the world? Answer - I have already answered that above (p 1826F) The bodhisattva who has obtained the acquiescence that dharmas do not arise (anutpattikadharmaksanti), who has obtained a body born of the fundamental element (dharmadhatujakaya), who manifests by metamorphosis in different places <2242> is able to save beings (sattvataranaya) and adorn the universes (lokadhatuparisodhanaya) As a result of these merits (punya), even before becoming Buddha, he can purify the offerings (daksina) Dustacittaparivarjana Fourth Section AVOIDING EVIL MINDS Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 29, l 14-18; Satasahasrika, p 95, l 11-20) - Moreover, Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to not produce thoughts of avarice, immorality, malice, laziness, distraction or false wisdom should practice the perfection of wisdom (Punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvena mahasattvena matsaryacittam dauhsilyacittam vyapadacittam kausidyacittam viksepacittam dausprajnacittam anutpadayitukamena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - These six kinds of minds that are evil close the door to the six perfections (paramita) I MIND OF AVARICE Thus, when the bodhisattva is practicing generosity (dana) and a mind of avarice (matsarya) arises in him, it makes the gift impure (avisuddha); sometimes, he will not give pure things; or if he gives external things, 131 Thus, when Manjusri was king Akasa, in the presence of the Tathagata Meghasvara, he applied his mind to perfect enlightenment and formulated the following vow: Naham tvaitarupena bodhim praptum ihotsahe / parantakotim sthasyami satvasyaikasya karanat // I am in no haste to attain enlightenment and I will remain here until the end while there remains a single being to be saved (Ratnakuta, T 310, k 59, p 346a9-10, cited in Siksasamuccaya, p 14, l 7-8; compare Bodhicaryavatara, III, v 21 1852he does not [304a] give a lot of them; or if he gives inwardly, he does not give fully: all of this because of the thought of avarice But if the bodhisattva cultivates the perfection of wisdom, he knows that all dharmas are without me’ (anatman), without mine’ (anatmiya), empty (sunya), like a dream (svapnopama), like a magic show (mayopama); then he gives his body (kaya), his head (siras), his eyes (nayana), his bones (asthi), his marrow (majja) as if they were [ordinary] bits of grass or pieces of wood (trnakastha)132 Although this bodhisattva has not yet attained sambodhi, he always avoids producing a thought of avarice and [to this end] he will practice the perfection of wisdom <2243> II THOUGHT OF IMMORALITY Other people, having attained bodhi by renunciation of desire (vairagya), do not produce the thought of immorality (dauhsilyacitta) The bodhisattva, because he is practicing the perfection of wisdom, envisages nothing as immoral Why? Morality (sila) is the abode (avasa) of all good qualities (kusalaguna), just as the earth (prthivi) is the support (asraya) and the basis for all things (dravya) An immoral man cannot obtain any bodhi; how then would he be able to obtain the supreme and perfect sambodhi? This is why the bodhisattva produces no thought of immorality Moreover, he has the following thought: It is a rule for bodhisattvas to create happiness for beings; the immoral man, however, disturbs the entire world This is why the bodhisattva does not produce any mind of immorality nor, a fortiori, any immoral [action] III MIND OF MALICE It is already forbidden to a Hinayanist or a lay person (prthagjana) to produce a thought of malice (vyapadacitta), all the more reason it is forbidden to a bodhisattva who has produced the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment The body (kaya) is a vessel of suffering (duhkhabhajana): it suffers vexations Thus the murderer (vadhaka) himself goes to his punishment: of what he himself has committed, he himself suffers the consequences,133 he cannot give it to another Only by protecting his own mind is he able not to experience malice It is like when one is suffering from wind (vatya), rain (varsa), cold (sita) or heat (usna), there is no use in becoming irritated 132 On these gifts, commemorated mainly on the great stupas in north-western India, see above, p 143-145F, note 133 Canonical recollection: Majjhima, III, p 181: Taya v’etam papam kammam katam; tvan neva tassa vipakam patisamvedissasi 1853Furthermore, the bodhisattva has the following thought: If the bodhisattva seeks to become Buddha, it is as a result of his great compassion (mahakaruna) When he gives himself up to anger (dvesa), he is violating his vows The wicked man does not obtain the happiness of this world (laukikasukha); how then would he obtain the bliss of bodhi? The wicked man does not find happiness for himself; how could he give it to others? <2244> IV MIND OF LAZINESS The lazy man (kusida) cannot realize worldly deeds; how then would he realize supreme complete enlightenment? When pieces of wood (arani) are rubbed together to make fire and if [in this [process] one is interrupted many times, one never gets a fire made V DISTRACTED MIND The distracted mind (viksepacitta) is like a lamp (dipa) in the wind which has light but does not illuminate objects It is the same for the wisdom (prajna) in a distracted mind Wisdom is the root (mula) of all good dharmas (kusaladharma) In order to realize (abhinirhr-) this wisdom, it is first necessary to concentrate the mind: it is only afterwards that one will realize it A drunk man (unmatta) makes no distinction between his own interest (svartha) and the interest of others (parartha), between beautiful things (suvarna) and ugly things (durvarna) It is the same for the man with a distracted mind: unable to recognize well beautiful worldly (laukika) things, how would he discern the supramundane (lokottara) dharmas? VI MIND OF FALSE WISDOM The mind of a silly person (muḍha) cannot attain success or setbacks134 or, a fortiori, subtle (suksma) and profound (gambhira) notions A man deprived of sight [304b] falls into the ditch or takes wrong paths; it is the same for the man deprived of knowledge; without the eye of wisdom (prajnacaksus), he adopts (abhinivisate) wrong doctrines (mithyadharma) and does not welcome the right view (samyagdrsti) Such a man has no success in the worldly things near him (samipe); how could he have it in supreme perfect enlightenment? 134 The silly person is incapable of appreciating the banalities of the present life 1854By practicing the perfection of wisdom, the bodhisattva can counteract the six opposing [vices]135 (saḍvipaksa) and purify (parisodhayati) <2245> the six perfections (paramita) This is why the Prajnaparamitasutra says here that the bodhisattva who does not want to produce the six opposing [vices] should practice the perfection of wisdom Punyakriyavastu Fifth Section ESTABLISHING BEINGS IN THE PUNYAKRIYAVASTUS PRELIMINARY NOTE The punya-kriya-vastus are the places of the practicing (vastu = adhisthana) of meritorious (punya) action (kriya) The expression is rendered in Tibetan by bsod-nams bya-bahi dnos-pa, in Chinese as fou-tch’ou by Kumarajiva, as fou-ye-che by Hiuan-tsang According to the canonical sutras (Digha, III, p 218; Anguttara, IV, p 241; Itivuttaka, p 51), these places of practicing are three in number: i) generosity: dana, sbyin, che in Kumarajiva, pou-che in Hiuan-tsang ii) morality: sila, tshul-khrims, tch’e-kiai in Kumarajiva, kiai in Hiuan-tsang iii) meditation: bhavana, bsgom-pa, sieou-ting in Kumarajiva, sieou in Hiuan-tsang As the Kosa, IV, p 232, comments, the three things - generosity, morality and meditation - are merit, action and place of practice, each according to its nature (punyam api etat trayam kriyapi vastv api yathayogam iti punyakriyavastu) In this context, generosity is not the thing given (deya), but rather that by means of which something is given’ (diyate yena tad danam), namely, the act (kriya) of giving Giving is a physical and vocal action and that which produces this action (kayavakkarman sotthanam): a collection of mind-and-metal-events by 135 The characters lieou pi used here by Kumarajiva certainly correspond to Saḍvipaksa: cf Mahayanasutralamkara, p 164, l17, to its Chinese version in T 1604, k 12, p 651c4 This concordance hs been shown by G M Nagao in his Index to the Mahayana-Sutralamkara, I, p 221, l 21 The saḍvipaksas are the six evil minds, avarice, etc, opposing the six paramitas: see also Sutralamkara, p 166, l 1-2; Samgrahopanibandhana, T 1598, k 7, p 422b19-21; Abhidharmasamuccayavyakhya, T 1606, k 12, p 750a25-28 Other references in H Nakamura, Bukkyßgo Daijiten, III, p 1450c-d 1855means of which this physical and vocal action is produced (yena kalapenacaittakalapa) But the Buddha said (Anguttara, III, p 415) that action is volition (cetana) and action after having willed (cetayitva karman); this is why, according to the Kosa (IV, p 233), some scholars claim that, to be precise, meritorious action is good volition (kusalacetana); generosity, morality and meditation are the place of practice (vastu) of this volition The second place of practice of meritorious action is morality (sila), more precisely, the fivefold morality consisting of abstention from killing, theft, illicit sexual activity, falsehood and liquor These five abstentions (prativirati) are not actions strictly speaking and have been studied above (p 784-819F) Anguttara, IV, p 241-243, explains that generosity and morality can be practiced in a small way, a medium way or a grand way They procure, respectively, <2246> rebirth among unfortunate people, among fortunate people, or among the six classes of gods of the desire realm Of greater benefit still is the place of practice consisting of meditation (bhavana) According to the Itivuttaka, p 19-22, the value of material gifts is only a sixteenth part of that of meditation, and the best meditation is loving-kindness (maitri) or the mind of loving-kindness (maitracitta), the first of the immeasurables (apramana), also called brahmaviharas because they assure <2246> rebirth among the higher gods of rupadhatu (= Brahmaloka) and arupyadhatu (see Traite, p 1264-1267F, note) The three punyakriyavastus are defined in the Sarvastivadin Abhidharmas such as the Samgitiparyaya, T 1536, k 5, p 385c12-386a26 (transl K Mittal and V Rosen, p 81-82) and the Mahavibhasa, T 1545, k 82, p 424b20-25 The Mahaprajnaparamitasutras add two other punyakriyavastus to the three basic ones, but there are divergences among the original Sanskrit and their various Chinese and Tibetan versions Pancavimsati, p 30, l 1-2: vaiyavrtyasahogatam caupadhikam punyakriyavastu, place of practice accompanied by service and material place of practice Satasahasrika, p 96, l 7-8 and 10: airyapathasahagatam punyakriyavastu,  ausadhikasahagatam (correct: aupadhikasahagatam) punyakriyavastu, place of practice accompanied by material objects Version of Hiuan-tsang, T 220, vol VII, k 402, p 9c13: kong che fou ye che (upasthanam punyakriyavastu) and yeou yi fou ye che (aupadhikam punyakriyavastu), place of practice consisting of service, and place of practice consisting of material objects Tibetan version in Tib Trip Vol 18, no 731, p 54, fol 36b7: rim gro las byun ba dan / dnos po thams cad byun las bsod nams bya bahi dnos po / In his translation of the present passage (T 1509, p 304b8-9), Kumarajiva departs considerably from the original Indian He mentions two fou-tch’ou (punyakriyavastu), the first consisting of k’iuan-tao, the second of ts’ai and fa K’iuan-tao perhaps is the original Indian samadapana (cf G M Nagao, Index to the Mahayana-Sutralamkara, I, p 258) and would mean an incentive (in Tib, bskul-ba) to do something’ As 1856for ts’ai-fa, it can only mean the two kinds of generosity - material gift (amisadana) and the gift of the Dharma or teaching (dharmadana) - mentioned in the sutras (Anguttara, I, p 91; Itivuttaka, p 98) The Mahavyutpatti, no 1700-1704 also has five punyakriyavastus Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 29, l 18-30, l 2; Satasahasrika, p 96, l 1-11) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom of he wants to establish all beings in the place of practice of the meritorious action consisting of generosity, in the place of practice consisting of morality, in the place of practice consisting of meditation, in the place of practice consisting of incentive; if he wants to establish beings in meritorious material works and in meritorious works of the Dharma (Punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvena mahasattvena sarvasattvan danamayapunyakriyavastuni silamayapunyakriyavastuni bhavanamayapunyakriyavastuni samadhapanamayapunyakriyavastuni pratisthapayitukamena , sarvasattvan aupadhikapunyakriyavastuni dharmapunyakriyavastuni pratisthapayitukamena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Question - What is the place of practice of meritorious action (punyakriyavastu) called? Answer - The Abhidharma says that merit (punya) is an action of body, speech or mind (kayavanmanaskarma) that is good-impure (kusalasasrava) Some say that it is unobscured-indeterminate (anivrtavyakrta) Why? Because as a result of a good-impure action, one obtains as fruit of retribution (vipakapjhala) a merit (punya) which is also unobscured- indeterminate, and that this fruit of retribution, it too, is called merit136 In the same way, worldly people call a meritorious man’ [not only the man who carries out meritorious actions] but the one who, having actualized great things, has multiplied his successes In brief (samksepena), this merit is of three kinds: it consists of generosity (dana), morality (sila) and meditation (bhavana) I PUNYAKRIYAVASTU CONSISTING OF GENEROSITY 1 Definition of generosity What is generosity (dana)? When one gives a man garments (civara), beds and seats (sayanasana), food and drink (annapana), flowers (puspa), perfumes (gandha), necklaces (muktahara), etc, that is a gift’ 136 In other words, merit is not only the good-impure meritorious action, but also the unobscured-indeterminate fruit of retribution of this action 1857Question - But [by themselves], these things, food, drink, etc, are already gifts Why is it still necessary to give them? Answer - No, these things - food, drink, etc - are not gifts It is at the moment when these things, food, drink, etc, <2248> are given that there arises in the mind [of the giver] a dharma of renunciation (tyaga) opposed to the thought of avarice (matsaryacittasya vipaksa) and called merit consisting of generosity’ (danamayapunya) This merit is sometimes pure (subha) and sometimes impure (asubha) It is always a good mental event (kusalacaitta) associated with the mind (cittasamprayukta), accompanying the mind (cittanuparivartin) arising with the mind (cittasahaja) It is without form (rupa) and without shape (samsthana) It is object- producing (alambanikarana)137 It is associated with action (karmasamprayukta), accompanying action (karmanuparivartin) and arisen with action (karmasashaja) It is not fruit of retribution of an earlier action (purvakarmavipakaphala) It is developed by acquisition (pratilambhabhavita) and developed by practice (nisevanabhavita)138 It is to be realized by wisdom (prajnaya saksilartavya) and to be actualized physically (kayena saksikartavya)139 It is acquired (prapta) by worldly persons (prthagjana) and also by the saints (arya)140 Others say that meritorious action consisting of generosity (danamayapunyakriya) is the volition (cetana) associated with the gesture of renunciation (tyagasamprayukta) Why? Because it is action (karman) that produces the fruit of retribution (vipakaphala) and volition is action141 Body (kaya) and speech (vac) are not, strictly speaking, action; it is when they arise from volition that they are called action <2249> 2 Pure and impure generosity142 137 Object-producing as reflection (manasikara), changing of the mind (cittabhoga); cf Kosa, VII, p 23 138 Cultivation (bhavana) of dharmas is done in four ways: i) by acquisition (pratilambha) of good dharmas not yet arisen; ii) by practice (nisevana) of good dharmas already arisen; iii) by opposition (pratipaksa) to bad dharmas not yet arisen; iv) by driving out bad dharmas already arisen See above, p 1123-1124F, the definition of the four samyakpradhanas and compare Kosa, VII, p 64 The meritorious action consisting of generosity is good (kusala) although impure; it can thus be cultivated by acquisition or by practice 139 According to Digha, III, p 230 and Anguttara, II, p 183, there are four kinds of dharma to be witnessed, to be actualized (saksikaraniya): i) to be witnessed by the body (kayena), namely, the eight vimoksas, but particularly the third and the eighth vimoksa (see above, p 1296F and notes); ii) to be witnessed by the memory (smrti), namely, earlier lifetimes (purvanivasa); iii) to be witnessed by the divine eye (divyacaksus), namely, deaths and births (cyutyupapada); iv) to be witnessed by wisdom (prajna), namely, the destruction of the impurities (asravanam ksaya) - On the way of witnessing by means of the body, see Kosa, VIII, p 210-211 140 In a word, according to the time-honored expression, it is prthagjanaryasamtanika (Kosabhasya, p 458, l 9) 141 Anguttara, III, p 415: Cetanaham bhikkhave kammam vadami 142 This subject has been studied already, p 664-666F, 1902-1903F This entire section appears to be an amplification on a Danasutra and a Danavastusutra dealing with the eight kinds of generosity and the motives (vastu) by which the 1858This gift (dana) is of two kinds: i) pure (visuddhi), ii) impure (avisuddhi) A The following gifts are impure: 1) the nearby gift (asadya dana);143 2) the gift made out of fear (bhayadana) of losing the object; 3) the gift made out of fear of curses; 4) the gift because the object has no more use; 5) the gift made out of friendship (maitradana); 6) the gift made because one is seeking power (prabhava); 7) the gift because one obtains power by giving; 8) the [304c] gift made because death is close; 9) the gift made with the view of a good reputation (kirtyartham danam); 10) the gift made in order to be as famous as noble individuals; 11) the gift made out of jealousy (irsya); 12) the gift made out of pride (mana), saying to oneself: Little people and low people give generously; why should not I, a noble and great individual, give?; 13) the gift made in order to obtain blessing; 14) the gift made to attract good fortune and avoid bad luck; 15) the gift made in order to penetrate into a society (parivara); 16) the gift made distractedly, without care and disregarding the beneficiary (pratigrahaka)There are many motivations of this type These gifts aiming at benefits in the present life (ihaloka) are counter to purity (visuddhi) and are called impure (avisuddha) <2250> B The pure (visuddha) gift is, as the sutra has said,144 the gift to purify the mind (cittavisodhanartham), the gift to adorn the mind (mano lamkarartham), the gift to acquire the supreme goal (paramarthasya praptaye), the gift producing a pure thought (visuddhacitta) capable of discerning what is favorable to nirvana The gift made with a pure mind is like a young flower, unblemished, of beautiful color and exquisite perfume It is said that if the gods give with impure intentions, the brilliance of their palace decreases; but if gift may be inspired: the first seven are self-interested and consequently impure (avisuddhi); only the eighth, aiming at detachment from the world and nirvana, is pure (visuddhi) As always, the Traite uses here the Sanskrit version of these sutras which may be found in the Saagitisutra and the Saagitiparyaya (ed K Mittal and V Roen, p 188-191), the Kosabhahasya, p 270, l 21-22 and the Kosavyakhya, p 434, l 31-435, l 8: Astau danani: 1) asadya danam dadati, 2) bhayad danadadati, 3) adan me danam dadati 4) dasyati me danam dadati, 5) dattam purvam me pitrbhih pitamahair itidanam dadati, 6) svargartham danam dadati, 7) kirtyartham danam dadati, 8a) cittalamkarartham, 8b) cittapariskarmartham, 8c) yogasambharartham, 8d) uttamarthasya praptaye danam dadati Transl - Eight gifts: 1) the nearby gift, 2) the gift made out of fear, 3) the gift made ’because he gave to me’, 4) the gift made ’so that he will give to me’, 5) the gift made because my father and my grandfather gave’, 6) the gift made to gain heaven, 7) the gift with reputation in mind, 8a) the gift made to adorn the mind [to obtain rddhi], 8b) to strengthen the mind [with the margangas], 8c) to provide the mind in view of yoga, 8d) to attain the supreme good [ie, arhathood, nirvana] For the corresponding Pali version, see Digha, III, p 258, l 10-16; Anguttara, IV, p 236, l 1-8; 236, l 13- 237, l 3 The eighth gift is briefly formulated there: cittalankaracittaparik-kharattham 143 Kosabhasya, p 270, l 21-22: Asadya danam yad asannebhya upagatebhyo danam dadati pauranah - According to the early teachers, the asadya gift (Pali: asajja) is made to persons who are close’, ie, having come from nearby 144 The Danastusutra which has just been cited 1859they give with pure intention, the brilliance of their palace increases The act of giving does not perish even after hundreds of myriads of lifetimes: it is like a debt (rna)145 3 Increase of merit Question - How does the merit of generosity (danapunya) increase? Answer - When one gives at the desired time (kale), one obtains an increase of merit (punyabhivrddhi) [Kalasutta]146 - As is said in the sutra: When one gives in time of famine (durbhiksa), one obtains an increase of merit When one gives to someone who has come from afar (agantuka gamika) on desert trails or dangerous paths, when one gives constantly and uninterruptedly, when one thinks constantly of giving at the right time, then the merit of generosity increases See what has been said above (p 1413-1419F) on the six recollections in respect to the recollection of renunciation (tyaganusmrti) One gains much merit if one gives generously, if one gives to good people, if one gives to the Buddha, if the donor (dayaka) and the recipient (pratigrahaka) are pure, if one gives with a firm intention (niyatacitta), if one gives an object that one has tried hard to acquire, if one gives absolutely all that one has, if one gives in exchange for other things, if one gives one’s servants (bhrtya), one’s lands, etc Only the bodhisattva is the one who practices such gifts with resolve (asaya) 4 Models of generosity a Bodhisattva jatakas [Velamajataka]147 - Thus the bodhisattva Wei-lo-mo (Velama), having made gifts for twelve years, still offered <2251> richly adorned dairy cows, vases made of the seven jewels, courtesans - the three groups each containing 84,000 items - and also other things made of wood and food (annapana) in incalculable amounts [Visvantarajataka]148 - Thus the bodhisattva Siu-ti-nien-na (Sudinna), descending from his white elephant Chan-cheng (Sujaya), gave it to an enemy family; then, withdrawing to a distant mountain, he gave his two 145 See above, p 665F, n 2 146 Kalasutta (Anguttara, III,p 41), already cited above, p 671, n1 147 Velamajataka, see p 677-688F 148 On the Visvantarajataka, see above, p 713F, n 1 Add to the references already mentioned, the Sanskrit story in the Mulasarvasvadin Vinaya in the Samghabhedavastu II, ed R Gnoli, p 119-133 This Jataka has been the subject of some very interesting studies: D Schlingloff, Die Jataka-Darstellungen in Höhle 16 von Ajanta, in Beiträge zur Indienforschung, 1977, p 462-466; R F Gombrich, A Sinhalese Cloth Painting of the Vessantara Jataka, in Buddhism 1860dear children to a brahmana with twelve uglinesses;149 finally, he gave his wife and his eyes to a fictive brahmana At that very moment the earth shook (bhumicala); there was thunder and lightning and a rain of flowers fell from the sky [Sarvamdadajataka]150 - Thus king Sa-p’o-ta-to (Sarvamdada) chained up his own body and gave it to a brahmana [Sibijataka]151 - Thus king Che-p’i (Sibi), in order to save a pigeon, removed [305a] a piece of flesh from his own body to exchange it for the pigeon [Sasajataka]152 - Thus when the Bodhisattva was a hare (sasa), he roasted his own flesh to give to a hermit (rsi) All this is told in the P’ou-sa-pen-cheng king (Bohisattvajatakasutra) <2252> b Sravaka jatakas There are also gifts of the sravakas: [Sumedhajataka]153 - Thus Siu-mi-t’o pi-k’ieou-ni (Sumedha bhiksuni) along with two co-disciples, built a vihara for the buddha Kia-na-k’ie-meou-ni (Kanakmuni) and, for numberless incalculable thousands of myriads of lifetimes, enjoyed bliss among the noble cakravartin kings and the devarajas in Ceylon and Studies on Religious Syncretism in Buddhist Countries, ed by H Bechert, 1978, p 78-88;

the bridge of his nose was narrow; his two eyes were green; his face was wrinkled; his lips hung down; his speech was stammering; he had a big belly and a prominent rear-end; his legs were crooked and deformed;

representations in India (Ajanta, Amaravati, Nagarjunakonḍa, Goli), in Central Asia (Qyzil), Java (Borobudur) On p 57, the author notes a Sasajataka incorporated in the Jatakamala (no 4) of Haribhatta This text has been published by M Hahn, Haribhatta and Gßpadatta, in Studia philological buddhica, I (1977), p 31-39, ed by the Reiyukai Library of Tokyo 153 The successive lives of Sumedha are told in the Therigathas, v 448-522 (p 167-174) and their commentary: Psalms of the Sisters (p 164-165) as well as in the Apadana (p 512-513) Under the buddha Konagamana, she and two of her companions, Dhananjani and Khema, made a gift of a vihara to the teacher Under the buddha Kassapa, she was a friend of the seven daughters of king Kiki of Benares and, as an upasika, was noted for her generosity which won her rebirth among the gods for innumerable times Finally, under the Buddha Sakyamuni, she was the daughter of king Konca of Mantavati She refused the hand of Anikadatta, 1861[Saivalajataka]154 Thus Che-p’o-lo (Saivala), enjoyed happiness from lifetime to lifetime and became an arhat for having offered a bottle of cream to the samgha: he is foremost among those who have found happiness (sukhalabhinam agrya) [Mallikajataka]155 - Thus Mo-li-fou-jen (Mallika), for an offering <2253> to Siu-p’ou-t’i (Subhuti), obtained a fruit of retribution (vipakaphala); she was the main wife of king Po-sseu-ni (Prasenajit), in the present lifetime (ihaloka) king of Varanavati, whom her parents wished her to accept After having converted her family and her entourage, full of distaste for the world, she left home and became a nun Shortly after, she attained arhathood In Therigatha, v 518, she tells about the gift that she and her two companions made to Konagama: Bhagavati Konagamane samgharamamhi navanivesamhi / sakhiyo tini janiyo viharadanam adasimha // 154 For Saivala (in Pali, Sivali), see above, p 1546F, n 1 and 1547, n 1 The Ekottara places Saivala among the physically and mentally happy men, always availing themselves of the four pujapariskara, - clothing, food, drink, bed and seat, medicine - and never falling into the three bad destinies The Mahavibhasa, T 1545, k 18, p 90b23-25; k 101, p 523a22-24, stresses his precocity during his successive lifetimes: as soon as he came into the world, he asked his parents if there was anything to give as alms 155 Jataka no 415, III, p 405-406 Mallika was the daughter of a garland-maker at Savatthi At sixteen years of age, she went into a flower garden, met the Buddha there and offered him three balls of barley gruel (kummasapinḍa) which she had been carrying in a basket of flowers The Teacher accepted the offering and smiled To Ananda who asked why he smiled, the Buddha explained: This young girl, in reward for her gift, will this very day become the main queen of the king of Kosala (ayam kumarika imesam kummasapinḍakanam phalena ajj’eva Kosalaranno aggamahesi bhavissati) Indeed, king Pasenadi who had just been conquered by Ajatasattu met the young girl in the garden and, finding her gentle as well as beautiful, saw her home That same evening, he sent for her in great pomp, seated her on a pile of jewels and conferred on her the anointment reserved for queens She became a faithful devotee of the Buddha as well as a good wife However, in Jatakamala no 3, p 14-18, Mallika attributes her good fortune to an act of generosity she had performed in one of her previous lives: when she was a slave, she had given the remains of a meal (uddrtabhakta) to a Muni whose impurities were destroyed Here the Traite has it that in the course of a single lifetime Mallika became the main wife of Prasenajit as a result of a gift made to Subhuti and not to the Buddha Having become queen, Mallika met the Buddha frequently The Mallikasutta of the Samyutta, I, p 75, and the Udana, p 47, tell that during a private conversation, Pasenadi asked Mallika if there was someone dearer to him than she herself Without heditation, she replied: Nobody is more dear to me than myself (n’atthi kho me maharaja koc-anno attana piyataro), and what is true for me is also true for you A little angry, the king went to consult the Buddha who said that Mallika clearly was right Then the Teacher spoke the stanza repeated in the Sanskrit Udanavarga, V, v 18 (p 144): Sarva disas tv anuparigamya cetasa / naivadhyagat priyataram armanah kva cit // Traveling in mind in every direction, never will you find someone dearer to yourself than you yourself 1862[Sivajataka]156 - Thus Che-p’o (Siva), for an offering to Kia-tchan-yen (Katyayana), obtained in the present existence a fruit of retribution: she is the main wife of king (Tchan-t’o-tccheou-t’o (Candrapradyota) [Ugratagrhapatijataka]157 - Thus Yu-k’ie’t’o kiu-che (Ugratagrhapati), for offering to five hundred arhats, Chö-li-fou (Sariputra), etc, on the same day obtained a fruit of retribution: five hundred merchants (vanij) who recieved the remains of his food each gave him a necklace (muktahara) and he became rich immediately As a result he was called suddenly rich’ Ugrata Such gifts find their fruit of retribution in this very lifetime, and we should know that the Upadesa declares them to be inexhaustible (aksaya) <2254> II PUNYAKRIYAVASTU CONSISTING OF MORALITY The place of practice of meritorious action consisting of morality (silamayapunyakriyavastu) is, in the words of the Buddha, meritorious action (punyakriya) consisting of the five precepts (pancasila) 158 Question - What are the characteristics (laksana) of the wrong-doing of killing (pranatipata)?159 Answer - Depriving someone of life, knowing full well that he is a living being (pranasamjni jivitad vyavaropayati), is to commit the wrong-doing of killing (pranatipata) To kill for no reason, calmly, absent-mindedly, is not committing the wrong-doing of killing; to deprive of life inattentively (viksepa) or out of mental disturbance (ksiptacitta) is not committing a wrong-doing of killing; to inflict a wound, (vrana) even though mortal, is not committing a wrong-doing of killing; a physical act (kayakarman) not involving death is not a wrong-doing of killing; a simple act of body or speech (vakkÂakarman) is not a wrong-doing of killing [because bad intention is lacking]; by itself, bad intention is not enough [because the implementation is absent] 156 For having made a gift to the great disciple Mahakatyayana, then chaplain to Canḍapradyota, king of Avanti, Siva, otherwise unknown, became the king’s wife 157 This is probably Ugrata-of-Vaisali (in Pali, Ugga Avesalika) who made six delightful gifts to the Buddha (Manapadayisutta of Anguttara, III, p 49-51) and who was proclaimed the foremost of the upasakas who make pleasing gifts Anguttara, I, p 26: manapadayakanam agga) The Buddha recognized eight wondrous extraordinary qualities in him (Uggasutta in Anguttara, IV, p 208-212; Madhyama, T 26, k 9, p 479c-481b); one day, he explained to him how certain beings are parinirvanized in this very life and others not (Vesalisutta in Samyutta, IV, p 109; Samyukta, Y 99, k 9, p 57b28-c13) As homonym, Ugrata had Ugra-of-Hastigrama (in Pali, Ugga hatthigamaka), proclaimed the foremost of the upasaka benefactors of the Community (Anguttara, I, p 26: sanghapatthakanam agga) Although the lives of the two grhapatis are atrangely similar, the Commentary of the Anguttara, I, p 394-396, dedicates distinct notes to them 158 See p 819-825F 159 See p 784-789F and n 1863The stopping, abstaining (prativirati) of this wrong-doing [of killing] constitutes the good characteristic of the first precept According to some, this abstention is unobscured-indeterminate (anivrtavyakrta) It belongs to the desire realm (kamadhatvavacara) or to no realm (anavacara) It is neither mind (citta) nor mental event (caitta), neither associated with the mind (cittasamprayukta) nor accompanying the mind (cittanuparivartin); sometimes it arises with the mind (cittasahaja) and sometimes not It is not associated with an action (karmasamprayukta) nor does it accompany the action (karmanuparivartin); sometimes it arises with an action (karmasahaja) and sometimes not It is not the fruit of an earlier action (purvakarmavipakaphala) It is developed by acquisition (pratilambhabhavita) and developed by practice (nisevanabhavita)160 It is to be realized physically (kayena saksikartavya) and to be realized by wisdom (prajnaya saksikartavya)161 Sometimes the thought (manaskara) [that accompanies it] is suppressed (bhinna), sometimes not; when one abandons the desires (raga) of the desire realm (kamadhatu), it is suppressed Abstention <2255> from killing occurs among worldly people (prthagjana) as well as among saints (arya) These are the characteristics (laksana) of the morality consisting of abstaining from killing (pranatipatavirati) For the other four moralities, [refraining from theft, from illicit sexual relations, falsehood and liquor], it is the same: each according to its type participates in morality They have been praised and commented on above (p 784-819F) in regard to the perfection of morality (silaparamita) III PUNYAKRIYAVASTU CONSISTING OF MEDITATION Although the sutra says that the meditation of loving-kindness (maitrabhavana) is the meritorious action consisting of meditation (bhavanamayi punyakriya), it also says that any impure meditation (sasravabhavana) able to produce a fruit of retribution usually is called meritorious action consisting of [305b] meditation162 Since the desire realm (kamaloka) abounds in hatred (dvesa) and distraction (viksepa), first of all we speak of the mind of loving-kindness (maitracitta) as the sphere of meritorious action consisting of meditation 160 Cf p 2248F, n 3 161 Cf p 2248F, n 2 162 The Itivuttaka, p 19, says that all material meritorious actions (opadhikani punnakiriyavatthuni) are worth only a sixteenth that of loving-kindness (metta), of deliverance of mind (cetovimutti) As we have seen above (p 1246-1255), loving-kindness is the first of the four immeasurables (apramana), also called brahmaviharas, and the meditation that takes them as object is the most fruitful of all Any meditation whatsoever, even if still impure, ie, blemished by error and passions, when it is cultivated or multiplied, gives its fruit of retribution and leads to happiness in the present life, to the conquest of knowledge and vision, to mindfulness and attentiveness Digha, III, p 222, l 17-24 and Anguttara, II, p 44, are categorical on this point: Samadhibhavana bhavita bahulikata ditthadhammasukhaviharaya nanadassanapatilabhaya  satisampajannaya  asavanam khayay samvattati 1864(bhavanamayi punyakriya) Metaphorically (upacaratas), loving-kindness is a wish (pranidhana) for the happiness of beings (sattvasukha); then it sees them really enjoying this happiness163 It is a dharma associated with the mind (cittasamprayukta) that is called loving-kindness (maitradharma) This dharma belongs to the realm of subtle form (rupadhatvavacara), or it belongs to no realm (anavacara): this, then, is the true maitri, the metaphorical (aupacarika) maitri itself belongs to the desire realm (kamadhatvavacara) <2256> Maitri always accompanies the mind (cittanuparivartin) and arises following the mind (cittasyanuja) It is without shape (asamsthana) and without resistance (apratigha) It grasps objects (dharman alambanikaroti) It is not an action (karman) but, associated with action (karmasamprayukta), it accompanies action (karmanucarin) and arises with it (karmasahaja) It is not the fruit of retribution of an earlier action (purvakarmavipakaphala) It is developed by acquisition (pratilambhabhavita) and developed by practice (nisevanabhavita) It is to be realized physically (kayena saksikartavya) and to be realized by wisdom (prajnaya saksikartavya) Sometimes in it thinking (manasikara) is cut, sometimes not: when one has transcended the desires (raga) of the realm of form (rupadhatu), it is cut Maitri may be with initial inquiry and with investigation (savitarkasavicara), without initial inquiry but with investigation (avitarkasavicara), without initial inquiry and without investigation (avitarkavicara)164 Sometimes it involves joy (priti), sometimes not;165 sometimes it involves the breath (asvasa-prasvasa) and sometimes not166 It occurs in worldly people (prthagjana) and in the saints (arya) Sometimes it is associated with a pleasant feeling (sukhavedana-samprayukta) and sometimes with a neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling (aduhkhasukhavedana-samprayukta) It has as its object (alambate) first an arbitrary characteristic (adhimuktilaksana), then, as object, a reality (tattvartha)167 Practiced in the four root dhyanas (mauladhyana) and beyond, maitri rests on the four dhyanas (caturdhyanasrita) Those who attain it are stable and strong Maitri may be called fondness’ (anunaya): free of malice (vyapada) and dispute (rana), it is called fondness’ Because it bears upon (alambate) beings infinite in number (apramanasattva), it is called an immeasurable’ (apramana) Because it encourages beings and frees them of desire (kama),168 it is called continence’ (brahmacarya) <2257> For other explanations of the mind of loving-kindness (maitracitta), see what has been said above (p 1246- 1255F) in regard to the four apramanas 163 See p 1254-1255F 164 Vitarka and vicara are eliminated in the second dhyana (p 1030F) 165 Priti and sukha, present in the second dhyana, are eliminated in the third dhyana (p 1030F) 166 In the ascetic who has attained the fourth dhyana, the inbreath and outbreath are eliminated: Digha, III, p 266; Samyutta, IV, p 217; Anguttara, IV, p 409 (Catutthajjhanam samapannassa assasapassasa niruddha honti) 167 The apramanas of which maitri is part are an arbitrary judgment (adhimuktimanasikara); only objective judgment (tattvamanasikara) cuts the passions: cf Kosa, VIII, p 200-201 168 Strictly speaking, maitri does not destroy desire, but it avoids it: see p 1242F, n 1 1865Question - In regard to the meritorious action consisting of meditation (bhavanamaya-punyakriya), why does the Buddha mention only the mind of loving-kindness and nothing about the other [three] immeasurables, ie, compassion, joy and equanimity? Answer - The mind of loving-kindness produces greater merit than all the other immeasurables169 The mind of compassion (karunacitta), being discontent (arati), loses merit The mind of joy (muditacitta) thinks of its own merit and consequently its merit is not deep (gambhira) The mind of equanimity (upeksacitta) is a rejection (utsarga) and consequently its merit also is slight Moreover, the Buddha said that the mind of loving-kindness has five advantages (anusamsa), but said nothing about the three other immeasurables What are these five advantages? - i) The knife (sastra) does not wound the benevolent man; ii) poison (visa) does not harm him; iii) fire (agni) does not burn him; iv) water (udaka) does not engulf him; v) in angry and wicked beings he sees only happy dispositions (sumanas)170 This is not the case with the other three immeasurables This is why [the Buddha] said that meritorious action consisting of meditation (bhavanamayapunyakriya) is maitri The other immeasurables follow; these are the impure meditations (sasravabhavana) producing a fruit of retribution (vipakaphala) IV PUNYAKRIYAVASTU CONSISTING OF ENCOURAGEMENT When the bhiksus can neither meditate nor recite the sutras, to advise them and encourage them is to gain merit When bhiksus who are meditating and reciting the sutras are lacking robes and food, giving these to them is also to encourage them Moreover, out of pity (anukampa) for beings, the bodhisattva encourages them by his merits If a monk were to look himself for material goods, <2258> he would be transgressing his discipline (sila); that is why there is a reason to encourage him V MERITORIOUS ACTIONS CONSISTING OF MATERIAL GIFTS AND OF TEACHING 169 The mind of loving-kindness has the advantage over the other three apramanas of producing a brahmic merit (brahmapunya); the ascetic who attains it is happy for a kalpa in the Brahma heavens: see Kosa, IV, p 2450-251, 170 In the words of the sutras, the concentration of loving-kindness brings five, eight, eleven advantages (anusamsa): cf p 792F, 1266F, n 1, and below, p 2362F 1866Material meritorious action (aupadhikapunyakriya) consists of robes (vastra), food and drink (annapana), beds and seats (sayanasana), medicines (glanabhaisajya), gold [305c] (suvarna), silver (rajata) vehicles (yana), horses (asva), fields (ksetra), houses (grha), etc171 <2259> Question - Above (p 2247F), you spoke about the place of practice of the meritorious action consisting of generosity (danamayapunyakriyavastu) and now you are speaking about the meritorious action consisting of material gifts (aupadhikapunyakriya); what are the similarities and what are the differences? Answer - The gifts [concerned above] included all gifts in general: material gift (amisadana) and gift of the Dharma (dharmadana);172 gifts according to the usage of the world (samvrti) and gifts in view of the 171 In the Pali suttas (Samyutta, I, p 233, l 15; Anguttara, IV, p 292, l 20; 293, l 10), it is a matter of opadhiikam punnam, glossed as upadhivipakam punnam in the commentaries of the Samyutta, I, p 352, l 4, and the Anguttara, IV, p 140, l 6 From that, the translations Merit forming a substratum for rebirth (Rhys Davids) or Verdienstliches als Substrat für ein besseres Dasein (Geiger) But in the Sanskrit sources, aupadikam punyam means the merit resulting from the gift of material objets, such as gardens or monasteries The Kosavyakhya, p 352, l 29 explains: upadhir aramaviharadih, tatrabhavam aupadhikam And in the present passage Kumarajiva renders aupadhikam punyam by ts’ai-fou merit coming from a gift of riches The Sanskrit Agamas dedicate a long sutra to the seven aupadhikani punyakriyavastuni and to the seven anaupadhikani punyakriyavastuni The original Indian text is cited in full in the Kosavyakhya, p 352, l 31-354, l 31, transl into Chinese in the Madhyamagama, T 26, k 2, p 427c25-428c5, and partially in Ekottaragama, T 125, k 35, p 741b21-c26 A There are seven material meritorious works When a believer, a son or daughter of good family, is endowed with them, whether he walks, stands still, lies down or sleeps, the merit increases in intensity incessantly; the merit grows (yaih samanvagatasya sraddhasya kulaputrasya va kuladuhitur va carato va tisthato va svapato va jagrato va satatasamitam abhivardhata eva punyam upajayata eva punyam) The believer who makes the following gifts to the community of monks of the ten directions (caturdisa bhiksusamgha) is endowed with these merits: 1) He gives a garden (aramam pratipadayati), 2) he establishes a monastery in this garden (tasminn evarame viharam pratisthapayati), 3) he furnishes this monastery with beds and seats (tasminn eva vihare sayanasanam prayacchati), 4) he assures regular offerings and appropriate oblations to this monastery (tasminn eva vihare dhruvabhiksam prajnapayaty anukulayajnam), 5) he gives a gift to the new arrival (agantukaya gamikaya danam dadati), 6) he gives a gift to the sick person or to his nurse (glanaya glanopasthayakaya va danam dadati), 7) when it is cold, he offers meals, drinks, boiled rice or rice soups to the community (sitalikasu  bhaktani va tarpanani va yavagupanani va samghayabhinirhrtyanuprayacchati) B There are seven immaterial meritorious works (nirupadhika) which make merit increase also The believer is endowed with these merits who feels noble beneficent joy associated with renunciation of the world (pritipramodyam udaram kusalam naiskramyopasamhitam) when he hears that the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata is dwelling in such and such a village, is about to come, is on the way, has come; and when this same believer comes to see him, hears the Dharma from his mouth, finally takes refuge and takes on the precepts 1867Path Here we want to distinguish the gift of the Dharma (dharmadana) from the material gift (aupadhikadana) It was a gift of the Dharma when the Buddha, out of his great loving-kindness (mahamaitri), turned the Wheel of the Dharma for the first time and innumerable beings found bodhi It was a gift of the Dharma when Sariputra, following the Buddha, turned the Wheel of the Dharma173 Other saints (aryapudgala), without having turned the Wheel of the Dharma, nevertheless preached the Dharma to beings and found bodhi: this also is called gift of the Dharma Moreover, the bodhisattva Pien-ki (Samantabhadra), the bodhisattvas Kouan-che-yin (Avalokitesvara), Tö- ta-che (Mahasthamaprapta), Wen-chou-che-li (Manjusri), Mi-lö (Maitreya), etc, put to work the power of their two kinds of superknowledge (abhijna) - the abhijna of fruit of retribution (vipakaphala) and the abhijna acquired by practice (bhavanaparilambhika)174 - and here too have saved beings by means of their skillful means (upaya), their brilliance (aloka), the bases of their miraculous powers (rddhipada) and all sorts of other means: this also is called gift of the Dharma <2260> The pratyekabuddhas who fly in the sky175 and those who lead beings to plant the roots of good (kusalamulavaropanaya) by speaking a single verse: this also is called gift of the Dhrma Finally, the disciples of the Buddha (buddhasravaka) who have not yet attained the noble Path (aryamarga) but who, sitting in meditation (pratisamlayana), recite the sutras without contradicting the nature of things (dharmata)176 and convert (paripacayanti) disciples: this also is called gift of the Dharma Everything of this type is characteristic of the gift of the Dharma This is why the Prajnaparamitasutra says here that the bodhisattva who wants to establish beings in the six kinds of meritorious actions (punyakriya) should practice the perfection of wisdom 172 The distinction between amisadana and dharmadana is canonical: see p 692F note 173 In Samyutta, I, p 191, the Buddha said to Sariputra: Seyyathapi Sariputta ranno cakkavatissa jetthaputto pitara pavattitam cakkam sammad eva anupavatteti, evam eva kho tvam Sariputta maya anuttaram dhammacakkam pavattitam sammad eva anupavattesi - Just as the oldest son of a cakravartin king correctly turns the wheel (of sovereignty) already moved by his father, so you also, Sariputra, correctly turn the Wheel of Dharma already moved by me See also Majjhima, III, p 29; Anguttara, I, p 23; III, p 149; Suttanipata, v 557 (p 109); Theragatha, v 827 (p 79); Divyavadana, p 394 (already mentioned above, p 633F, n 2) 174 These are the innate or natural abhijnas (upapattipratilambhika) and the abhijnas born from meditation (bhavanamaya) See in Kosa, II, p 328, the four kinds of attention (manaskara) 175 Cases of pratyekabuddhas taking flight have been noted by Chavannes, Contes, I, p 312; II, p 33; III, p 51 176 According to the rules of inner criticism formulated in the Mahapadesa, for a text to be authentic it must be found in the sutras (sutre vatarati), appear in the Vinaya (vinaye drsyate) and not contradict the nature of things (dharmatam na vilomayati), ie, the pratityasamutpada References in E Lamotte, La critique d’authenticite dans le bouddhisme, in India Antiqua, 947, p 218-222 1868Panca caksumsi Sixth Section OBTAINING THE FIVE EYES’ Preliminary Note - In the literal sense, the word caksus, eye’, means the organ of the eye which, together with the visibles, produces the visual consciousness; hence the stock phrase: cakkhum ca paricca rupe ca uppajjati cakkhuvinnam (Samyutta, II, p 72) In the figurative sense, the eye is a seeing and, more particularly, the seeing of the four noble Truths with the three turnings and twelve aspects: the tales that describie the night of enlightenment, that review each of the twelve aspects, that reviw each of these twelve aspects, consider it good to repeat the refrain: caksur udapadi, jnanam vidya buddhir udapadi the eye is born; the knowledge, the intellect, the erudition will be born (Pali Vinaya, I, p 11; Catusparisad, p 144- 152; Samghabhedavastu, I, p 135-136) Eye’ can be synonymous with knowledge, intelligence, erudition Caksus often appears in composite form; its meaning is then determined by the word that precedes it From the canonical sutras, we can find the following compounds: Mamsacaksus (mamsacakkhu), fleshly eye: Itivuttaka, p 52, repeated in Kathavatthu, p 251 Divyacaksus (dibbacakkhu), divine eye: Digha, I, p 82, 162; III, p 52, 281; Majjhima, I, p 213; Samyutta, I, p 144, 196; II, p 122, 213-214, 276; IV, p 240, 243; V, p 266, 305; Anguttara, I, p 165, 256, 281; III, p 19, 29, 418; IV, p 85, 141, 143, 178, 291; V, p 13, 35, 38, 68, 200, 211, 340 Prajnacaksus (pannacakkhu), wisdom eye: Samyutta, IV, p 292; V, p 467 <2261> Dharmacaksus (dhammadakkhu), Dharma eye: Samyutta, II, p 134; IV, p47, 107 Buddhacaksus (buddhacakkhu) Buddha eye: Digha, II, p 38; Samyutta, I, p 138 Samantacaksus, universal eye (epithet of the Buddha): Samyutta, I, p 137 Nine times out of ten, in the canonical sutras each of these caksus is mentioned in isolation, but with time, there was a tendency to group them together Two classifications finally were used: the first listed three caksus, the second, five; and the schools’ positions lasted for a long time 1 The classification into three cakusus groups the mamsa-, the divya- and the prajnacaksus It appears in some rare canonical sutras: Samgitisutra (Digha, III, p 219; Dirgha, T 1, k 8, p 50b21; T 12, k1, p 228b1); Ekottaragama, T 125, k 1, p 550c2; Pali Itivittaka, p 52 It is the rule in the Sarvastivadin-Vaibhasika Abhidharmas and sastras: Samgitiparyaya, ed Mittal-Rosen, p 86, or T 1536, k 5, p 388a15-20; Compilation by Vasumitra, T 1549, k 2, p 732a2; Mahavinhasa, T 1545, k 73, p 379c7-8; Samyuktabhidharmasara, T 1552, k 1, p 873a29-b1 It is also found in works of uncertain origin, such as the Sariputrabhidharma, T 1548, k 9, p 599c26; 593a21-28 18692 The classification into five caksus, firmly adopted by the Traite, groups the mamsa- divya- prajna- dharma- and buddhacaksus In principle, the Buddha alone holds all five, but he does not use them all at the same time (see Bove, p 429-440F) The classification into five caksus is fully detailed in the Mahavastu, I, p 158-160, a Mahasamghika- Lokottaravadin work The Lalitavistara, a work of pronounced Mahayana tendenies, only mentions them quickly (p 3, l 5; 403, l 2) Above all, the Mahayana knows no other and often devotes lengthy definitions to them: Pancavimsati, p 77, l1-80, l 18; Satasahastika, p 290, l 12-301, l 2; Avatamsaka, T 279, k 50, p 268a12; T 291, k 2, p 600b10; T 292, k 6, p 659b14-24; Ratnakuta, T 310, k 41, p 240a14; k 85, p 486c4, 489b7; Sukhavativyuha, T 363, k 3, p 324c11; T 364, k 2, p 335b17; Mahasamnipata, T 397, k 5, p 30a18; k 7, p 43a13 The Vijnanavadins do not pay much attention to the five caksus, but a passage from the Mahayanasutralamkara, p 143, l 8-9, shows that they had adopted them The Pali sources, at least the less late ones, also show a list of five caksus where the samanatacakkhu appears in place of the dhammacakkhu: Cullaniddesa, no 235, p 133; Atthasalini, p 306 Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 30, l 3-5; Satasahasrika, p 96, l 11-20) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to obtain the five eyes must practice the perfection of wisdom (Punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvena mahasattvena panca caksumsi nispadayitukamena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) <2262> Sastra - What are these five? 1) The fleshly eye (mamsacaksus), 2) the divine eye (divyacaksus), 3) the wisdom eye (prajnacaksus), 4) the Dharma eye (dharmacaksus), 5) the Buddha eye (buddhacaksus) 1 The fleshly eye (mamsacaksus) sees what is close up (samipe), does not see what is far off (dure); sees what is in front (purastata), does not see what is behind (prsthatas); sees what is external (bahis), does not see what is internal (abhyantare); sees during the day-time (diva), does not see at night-time (ratrau); sees what is on top (uparistat), does not see what is underneath (adhastat)177 2 Because of these screens, the bodhisattva seeks the divine eye (divyacaksus) Having obtained the divine eye, he sees what is distant and what is near, what is in front and what which is behind, what is internal and what is external, he sees during the day and during the night, he sees what is above and what is below, for there are no further screens This divine eye sees the provisional entities resulting from causes and conditions coming together (samghatahetupratyayaja), but he does not see the true nature (dharmata), namely, emptiness (sunyata), signlessness (animitta), wishlessness (apranihita), non-arising (anutpada), non-cessation (anirodha) 177 Similar development in a passage from the Karanaprajnapti cited by the Kosabhasya, p 19, l 9-14 18703 And it is the same as before: in order to see the true nature (dharmata), the bodhisattva seeks the wisdom eye (prajnacaksus) Having obtained the wisdom eye, he no longer sees beings (sattva), he eliminates completely the signs of identity (ekatva) and difference (nanatva), he rejects all clinging (adhyavasana) and accepts no dharma178 4 However, the wisdom eye cannot save beings Why? Because it does not distinguish them; this is why the bodhisattva produces the Dharma eye (dharmacaksus) By means of this eye, he knows that such and such a man, by practicing such and such a dharma, has obtained such and such bodhi;179 he knows all the methods (upayamukha) suitable for each being in particular (prthak prthak) [306a] to attain the realization of bodhi <2263> 5 But the Dharma eye cannot know the means appropriate to save beings everywhere; this is why the bodhisattva seeks the Buddha eye (buddhacaksus)180 There is nothing that this Buddha eye is unaware of; there is no mystery however secret it may be that it cannot discover What is distant for other people is close for the Buddha; what is obscure for others is clear for the Buddha; what is doubtful for others is clear for the Buddha; what is subtle (suksma) for others is coarse (audarika) for the Buddha; what is deep for others is shallow for the Buddha By means of this Buddha eye, there is nothing that is not understood, seen, known, felt (yena buddhackasusanmati kimcid asrutam vavijnnatam vamatam va)181 Free of thinking (manasikara), the Buddha eye is always clear on all dharmas In a following chapter,182 the meaning of the five eyes will be elucidated further Pratyutpannabuddhadarsana 178 Cf Pancavimsati, p 78, l 11-16: Prajnacaksusa samanvagato bodhisattvo mahasattvo na kamcid dharmam prajanati samskrtam vasamskrtam va  yena prajnacaksusa bodhisattvena mahasattvena kascid dharma na drsto na sruto na mato na vijnatah 179 These are particular bodhis capable of being acquired by beings on their course towards supreme bodhi These fruits of the Path’ are detailed in Pancavimsati, p 79 180 The Buddha eye is none other than the awareness of things in all their aspects (sarvakarajnata) acquired by the Bodhisattva the very night of his great enlightenment The Pancavimsati, p 82, explains: The Bodhisattva, having entered into the Vajropamasamadhi, by means of the wisdom associated with a single moment of mind attains the awareness endowed with all the aspects (vajropamam samadhim samapadya, ekacittaksanasamayuktaya prajnaya sarvakarajnatam anuprapnoti) 181 The expression drsta-sruta-vijnata-mata designates the group of perceived things: what is perceived by the eye consciousness is drsta, what is perceived by the ear consciousness is sruta, what is perceived by the mental consciousness is vijnata, what is perceived by the nose, tongue and body consciousnesses is mata (cf Kosa, IV, p 160) The expression is canonical and is expressed in Pali by the words dittham sutam mutam vinnatam: Majjhima, I, p 135; III, p 261; Samyutta, III, p 203; Anguttara, II, p 23, 25 182 Pancavimsati, p 77, l 1-83, l 6, appearing in the Wang cheng p’in of the Chinese translation, T 223, k 2, p 227b10-228b1, and commented on by the Traite, T 1509, k 39, p 347a6-351b1 1871Seventh Section SEEING, HEARING AND UNDERSTANDING ALL THE BUDDHAS OF THE PRESENT PRELIMINARY NOTE The five eyes’ find their use in visualization of the present, past and future Buddhas The visualization is not an appearance but rather a representation by means of which the ascetic makes these Buddhas visible While Sakyamuni was alive, many were the contemporaries who came to see the Blessed One’ (bhagavatam darsanayopasamkrantah) and to contemplate his physical marks The Teacher allowed himself to be examined by the experts and the hermit Asita (Traite, p 1344F, 1915F), by the indiscreet curiosity of Satyaka Nirgranthiputra (Traite, p 1665F) and by the brahmanas Ambattha, Brahmayu and Sela (Traite, p 275F, 1667F) After the death of the Blessed One, Ananda - and he was blamed for this - had no hesitation in uncovering the Buddha’s body and showing it to the women of Kusinagra who soiled it with their tears (Traite, p 96F) <2264> The appearance of a Buddha is rare, as rare as the flowering of the banana tree: fortunate are those that see the Blessed One adorned with the thirty-two marks of the great man, on whose limbs shine the eighty-four secondary marks, with a halo an arm’s-span in width, splendid as a thousand suns, like a mountain of jewels moving in all captivating ways’ This stock phrase is repeated thirty-two times in the Avadanasataka There is nothing supernatural in these encounters: it is with their human eyes that the Indians of Jambudvipa, during the lifetime of the Omniscient One, contemplated him who opened the gates to the deathless for them After his entry into parinirvana, gods and men did not see him any longer (Digha, I, p 46) - Just as the flame blown out by the wind is calmed down, goes beyond being seen, so the Sage, shedding the psychophysical aggregates of existence, enters into peacefulness, being beyond being seen (Suttanipata, v 1074) And so, if the Teacher allowed himself to be looked at while he was in this world, it was out of loving- kindness and compassion for beings to whom the sight would be useful The contemplation of the Buddha’s body never constituted a ritual, and when Buddhists practice the commemoration of the Buddha (buddhanusmrti), they think about his spiritual qualities, the five anasravaskandha, rather than his physical attributes The Traite has explained this subject above (p 1349F) The Dharma is the single refuge which Sakyamuni left for his disciples, and he passed on the depth of his mind when, tired of the regular attendance of his disciple Vakkali, he sent him away, saying: It is enough, Vakkali, for you to see my body of decay; he who sees the Dharma sees me and he who sees me sees the Dharma (cf Traite, p 1546F, n) The true body of the Buddha is a teaching body 1872The buddhology of the early times was relatively sinple: the Buddhas are born only in a univere of four continents (caturdvipalokadhatu), in India (Jambudvipa), in the central region (Madhyadesa), and two Buddhas never appear simultaneously in the same world (cf Traite, p 302F, n 1; 535F) The Buddhas who followed one another in our world were not very numerous: Sakyamuni included, the early Buddhists listed seven, twenty-five, rarely more Later, at the margins of this restricted universe, Buddhists built up a grandiose cosmic system which appeared already in certain texts of the Lesser Vehicle but which gained in importance in those of the Greater Vehicle This system distinguishes three kinds of complex universes: i) the sahasracuḍika consisting of a thousand universes of four continents, ii) the dvisahasra madhyama containing a million universes of four continents, iii) the trisahasramahasahasra including a billion universes of four continents The trisahasramahasahasras are distributed in the ten directions of space: east, south, west, north, north- east, north-west, south east, south west, nadir and zenith, and they are, in each of these ten directions, as numerous as the sands of one or several Ganges The majority also constitute Buddha-fields (buddhaksetra) where a Tathagata resides, lives, exists and teaches the Dharma for the welfare and benefit of many beings These Tathagatas, whose number is incalculable <2265> if not infinite, are the Buddhas of the present (pratyurpannabuddha): they were preceded by and will be followed in time by innumerable Buddhas of the past and the future (atitanagatabuddha) The bodhisattva of whom the Traite is speaking here formulates a series of wishes: to see the Buddhas of the present, hear their teachings and penetrate their mind; to remember the teachings of the Buddha of the present; to see the buddhaksetras of the Buddhas of the three times and to propagate the teachings of these same Buddhas To actualize these wishes is not an easy thing It cannot be a question of having recourse to human organs of limited range and coming up against many obstacles Calling upon the superhuman faculties is more successful: the divine eye (divyacaksus), the divine ear (divyasrotra) and the knowledge of another’s mind (paracittajnana), classified among the abhijnas and which, as we have seen, make up as many eyes’ taken in the metaphorical sense of the word But by themselves, they are unable to attain the edges of time and space, of seeing, hearing and understanding the innumerable Buddhas of the three times peopling the innumerable universes of the ten directions Generally, the divine eye and divine ear do not go beyond a trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu, and the knowledge of another’s mind does not know the actual minds: the past and the future are closed to it In order to see’ - ie, to see, hear and understand - the Buddhas of the ten directions and three times, one must seek other solutions, and the first Mahayanasutras proposed some Here it will be a matter of the Great Prajnaparamitasutras and the Pratyutpannasamadhisutras (T 416 to 419) 1873The Pancavimsati, the two oldest Chinese versions of which (T 221 and T 222) are dated respectively at 291 and 286 AD, present two explanations’ - if this word is appropriate here - of the vision of the Buddhas, the one by using, purely theoretically, the divyacaksus, the other, in dreams (svapna) 1 The bodhisattva who wishes to see, by the divyacaksus, all the Buddhas of the present, should practice the Prajnaparamita This seeing assumes a subject (the bodhisattva), an instrument (the divyacaksus), an object (the Buddhas of the present), but is valid only if it is realized in the view of the Prajnaparamita according to which the bodhisattva, the divyacaksus, the Buddhas and the Prajnaparamita itself are not perceived (nopalabhyate), that is to say, are not existent a What we call Prajnaparamita, what we call bodhisattva, are only words (namamatra), and this word exists neither inwardly nor outwardly nor in between (nadhyatmam na bahirdha nobhayam antarenopalabhyate); this word is only a designation, a thing by designation, existing out of designation (prajnaptimatram prajnaptidharmah prajnaptisat): cf Pancavimsati, p 99 (orT 223, p 230c): Satasahasrika, p 325 b The bodhisattva who practices the Prajnaparamita does not accept (nabhiniveksyate) any of the five eyes’ including the divyacaksus: cf Pancavimsati, p 106 (or T 223, p 231b24); Satasahasrika, p 380 c The bodhisattva who practices the Prajnaparamita does not see (na samanupasyati) either the Prajnaparamita or the bodhisattva or the Buddha or the words that express them: cf Satasahasrika, p 378, l 1-4; Pancavimsati, p 105, l 1-3 <2266> As well, the Prajnaparamita is the Buddha and is not different from him; and the Buddhas, past, future and present are Prajnaparamita: cf Pancavimsati,T 223, p 293b19-21 Consequently, the seeing of the Buddhas where there is neither subject nor instrument nor object is a non- seeing (adarsana) This is how the bodhisattva who is practicing the prajnaparamita penetrates deeply into the true nature of things, and this nature [which is none other than the absence of any nature] is neither defiled nor purified (bodhisattvena prajnaparamitayam carata dharmalaksanam (variant: dharmanam dharmalaksanam) supratividdham bhavati, yac ca dharmanam laksanam tan na samklisyate na vyavadayate): cf Pancavimsati, p 105, l 12 (or T 223, p 231b13-14); Satasahasrika, p 378, l 18 2 A son or daughter of good family, physically and mentally healthy, has no bad dreams (svapna) In dreams, he sees the Buddhas adorned with the major and minor marks, surrounded by the samgha of bhiksus, and preaching the Dharma He hears them explain the teaching of the six perfections, etc He sees the bodhi tree, the bodhisattvas approaching it to realize sambodhi and who, becoming Buddha, turn the Wheel of the Dharma He sees the hundreds of thousands of billions of kotis of bodhisattvas explain how it is necessary to seek omniscience, convert beings and purify the Buddha fields He sees the innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of kotis of Buddhas in the ten directions and he learns their names, the names of their regions and their ksetras He is present at their parinirvana and sees their innumerable stupas made of the seven jewels The son or daughter of good family who sees these good dreams sleeps happily and awakens happily: cf Pancavimsati, T 223, p 289c25-290a13 1874In this passage the Pancavimsati does not have the divyacaksus occur, but it recognizes that simple lay people, well-disposed, are able to see the Buddhas in dreams That would be by another mode of seeing But what is the value of it? A conversation between Sariputra and Subhuti, recorded in the Pancavimsati (T 223, p 347a) gives us an embryonic answer There is no difference between the state of awake and the state of sleep Nevertheless, an act performed (krta) in sleep is not accumulated (upacita), ie, attributable; it is necessary to wait for the conceptualizing (samkalpa) that follows the dream for it to be accumulated, for without conditions (pratyaya), action (karman) is not born Nonetheless, the Buddha has said that all dharmas are like dreams (svapnopama) and consequently are not born A vision of the Buddhas, different from those just described, is set forth in the Pratyutpannabuddha- sammukhavasthitasamadhisutra, in Tibetan Da ltar gyi sans rgyas mnon sum du b€ugs pahI tin ne hdzin the concentration of being face to face with the Buddhas of the present’ This sutra is often designated under the abbreviated title of Pratyutapannasamadhi or also Bhadrapalasutra because the bodhisattva thus named is the principal interlocutor of the Buddha This sutra is known to us by Sanskrit fragments coming from eastern Turkestan (cf R Hoernle, Manuscript Remains, p 88-93), by four Chinese versions and one Tibetan translation which I [Lamotte] will return to later <2267> This text is one of the oldest Mahayanasutras According to one conjecture, it may have been the manual of early Buddhists during the early Mahayana period (50-100AD) It is well known to the Chinese and Japanese Buddhists because it refers to worship of the Buddha Amitabha The assembly where this sutra was preached was simple, consisting only of 500 bhiksus and 500 bodhisattvas: this shows that the sutra goes back to the first days of the Mahayana The Chinese version in one kuan (T 417 and 419?) seems to have been composed before the Prajnaparamita-sutras or in a region where the thinking of the prajnaparamita had not been taught The Chinese version in three kuans (T 418) had been influenced by this thinking The Pratyutpanna-samadhi definitely influenced Pure Land Buddhism (H Nakamura, A Survey of Mahayana Buddhism with bibliographical notes, in Jour of Intercultural Studies, III (1976), p 83 Whereas the Prajnaparamitasutras represent mainly the Wisdom Sutras’, the Pratyutpanna-samadhisutra is classified among the Meditation Sutras’ elaborated at about the beginning of our era by Buddhist practitioners of the Yogacara school who were preoccupied with meditation rather than discussion, with mysticism rather than rationalism: an ancient tendency that appeared as early as the oldest canonical texts: cf L de La Vallee Poussin, Musila et Narada, in MCB, V (1936-37), p 189-222 The leader of the Yogacara Buddhists was Samgharaksa who was considered by the Sarvastivadins of Kasmir as one of their patriarchs A native of Surastra (Kathiawar), he lived in the 2nd century AD and was the teacher of Canḍana-Kaniska in Gandhara He compiled a Buddhacarita (T 194) and a Yogacarabhumi (T 606) to which P Demieville has dedicated an important dissertation (La Yogacarabhumi de Sangharaksa, BEFEO, XLIV (1954), p 339-436 The work originally contained 27 chapters describing the Hinayanist Yoga technique; in the translation made by Dharmaraksa it consists of 30 chapters The fact is 1875that the Mahayanists showed very strong interest in the Hinayanist dhyana as practiced by the Sarvastivadin communities of Kasmir and thereby there resulted a more or less hybrid literature The Pratyutpannasamadhisutra was written in this context but presents itself openly as Mahayanist As will be seen in the following pages, it advocates, for the use of lay people or monks, liberated or not liberated from desire, a concentration that puts them face to face with the Buddhas of the present To acquire this concentration, there is no need for the abhijna of the divine eye resulting from the practice of dhyana; all that is required is a probationary period followed by a session of intense meditation of from one to seven days, at the end of which, without changing one’s position, one sees the Buddhas of the present, Amitabha in particular Arising from this samadhi, one sees them no more: it is as if they were visions of a dream The Pratyutpannasamadhi is not only mentioned in the sutra that bears its name (T 418, etc); it is also mentioned in the Suramgamasamadhisutra (T 642, k 1, p 634a5), the Dasabhumikasutra (ed Rahder, p 82, l 15-16), the Dasabhumikavibhasa (T 1521, k 1, p 25c3; k 7, p 54a1; k 9, p 68c17; k 16, p 109b7), etc It seems that the Prajnapamaritas were not aware of it They accept that one may see the Buddhas in dream, but, as has been said above, they consider any seeing whatsoever as a purely subjective epiphenomenon brought on by wrong conceptualization (samkalpa) <2268> On the other hand, in its commentary on the Prajnaparamita, the Traite calls upon a good thirty Mahayanasutras (see Vol III, Introduction, p XXXIV and foll), and gives us ample information on the Prayutpannasamadhi Referring here exclusively to its Chinese version (T 1509), I [Lamotte] will mention a few passages as follows: The Pratyutpannasamadhi does not occur in bodhisattvas of the first seven bhumis who are still affected by a fleshly body (k 37, p 335b19; k 49, p 416a18; it belongs to bodhisattvas of the eighth bhumi who are assured of the eventual attainment of enlightenment (niyama) and have the certainty that dharmas do not arise: anutpattika dharmaksanti (k 4, p 86c3; k 27, p 262a20-21), as, for example, the lay bodhisattva Bhadrapala (k 7, p 11a18) By means of the upayas acquired in the seventh bhumi and the pratyutpannasamadhi acquired in the eighth bhumi, the bodhisattva is superior to the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas (k 35, p 320a10) Thanks to this samadhi, there is no need to obtain the abhijna of the divine eye (divyacaksus) in order to see all the Buddhas of the present occupying the innumerable universes distributed in the ten directions (k 9, p 123c29; k 33, p 306a15); it is by assiduous practice that a son of good family will be reborn in the paradise of Amita (k 29, p 276a18-19) Finally, the Pratyutpannasamadhi is the father of the Buddha (k 34, p 314a23), whereas the Prajnaparamita is his mother Does this mean that the Traite agrees with it unreservedly? Not at all Everything leads us to believe that even at that time there had arisen in India, probably in Kasmir, a controversy about the respective value of the Prajnaparamita and the Pratyutpannasamadhi In the following pages, the Traite reveals to us the depth of its thinking and places itself resolutely on the side of the partisans of the Prajnaparamita 1876The abhijnas practiced in the spirit of the Prajnaparamita are the best pointers’ of the Buddhas or, rather, the true nature of things with which the Tathagatas are mingled: the divine eye sees them, the divine ear hears them, the knowledge of others’ minds penetrates their mind Conceived in this way, the abhijnas present precious benefits Thus, the divyackasus is morally undefiled- indeterminate and, in this quality, does not involve any fruit of retribution; it is acquired solely by the ascetic detached from the desires of the kamadhatu; according to the Abhidharmas, it is a pure material (rupaprasada) endowed with perfect clarity; finally, its acquisition and its use are easy, provided that one holds the dhyanas which, although said in parentheses, is already not too bad! These noble qualifications are absent in the Pratyutpannasamadhi One no longer knows if the Buddhas whose presence it calls forth are like a dream or simple dreams, real or illusory One thing is certain: they result from conceptualization (samkalpa), from autosuggestion (k 33, p 306a19-21) The Prajnaparamita is the mother of the Buddhas Of the help given by the father and that given by the mother, that of the mother is the weightiest This is why the Buddha considers the Prajna as his mother and the Pratyutpannasamadhi as his father This samadhi is able only to concentrate the distracted mind (viksiptacitta); it helps the Prajna to be actualized but it cannot contemplate the true nature of things (dharmanam dharmata) [which is none other than the absence of nature] The Prajnaparamita itself contemplates the entirety <2269> of things and reveals the true nature, There is nothing that it does not penetrate, nothing that it does not realize, and its merit is so great that it is called Mother (k 34, p 314a21-26) With this statement, the author of the Traite places himself resolutely on the side of the rationalists who prefer gnosis to mysticism, prajna to yoga, discernment (vipasyana) to tranquility (samatha) Nevertheless, although he places the Pratyutpannasamadhi well below that of the Prajna, he does not hesitate to give it a certain usefulness This stand is part of the lineage of Buddhism It prefers the discernment of the Dharma to a vision of the Buddhas But did not Sakyamuni say to Vakkali: He who sees the Dharma sees me (Samyutta, III, p 120: yo kho dhammam passati so mam passati)? By not formally condemning the Prayutpannasamadhi, he applies the Teacher’s recommendations praising a middle way in a literal manner: The monks who devote themselves to trance (jhayin) blame the monks who are attached to the doctrine (dhammayoga) and vice versa On the other hand, they should esteem one another Indeed, rare are the men who pass their time (vihar-) by testing the immortal element (amata dhatu) Rare also are those who see the profound reality (arthapada) by penetrating it by means of Prajna, by means of the intellect (Anguttara, III, p 355-356) The debate between the rationalists and the mystics was centered around three texts which were among the first to be translated into Chinese 1877Under the Later Han (25-220 AD), the Yue-tche Tche Leou-kia-tch’an (Lokaksema) at Lo-Yang translated the three following sutras: 1) Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita (T 224) in 10 kiuan and 30 chapters, 179 AD 2) Pratyutpannasamadhisutra (T 418) in 3 kiuan and 16 chapters, 179 AD - Another version of the Pratyutpannasamadhisutra (T 417) in one kuan and not dated is also attributed to Lokaksema: it is probably an extract made of T 418 3) Suraagamasamadhisutra, translation made in 186 AD but which has not come down to us These translations are authenticated by ancient colophons reproduced in the Chinese catalogues See Surangamasamadhi, French transl, 1965, p 67-72 The Pancavimsati Prajnaparamita which, as we have just seen, deals with the vision of the Buddha, was the object of two translations under the Western Tsin (265-316 AD),: 1) T 222, incomplete, in 10 kiuan and 27 chapters only, made by Dharmaraksa in 286 2) T 221, in 20 kiuan and 90 chapters, finished in 291 by Moksala From the end of the 3rd century, these texts along with many others were the object of new Chinese translations, each time marking notable progress over the preceding ones On the historical and socio-cultural circumstances under which this huge work was effected, see P Demieville, Inde Classique, II, 1953, p 398-463;

E Zürcher, Conquest of China, I, p 219-222 The association, in which the lay people numbered 123, swore to collectively win the pure land of Amita and, in order to attain this goal, they practiced the Buddhanusmrtisamadhi concentration of recollection of the Buddhas’ This was a meditation somewhat different from the simple recollection of the Buddhas (buddhanusmrti) recommended in the canonical scriptures and which the Traite fully described above (p 1340-1361F) An intense meditation, very close to an autosuggestion, caused, at the first opportunity, a direct vision of the Buddhas of the present and more particularly of the Buddha of the West, Amita Among the disciples of Houei-yuan who engaged in this practice were Lieou Tch’eng-tche, Seng-tsi and Houei- 1878yong Hardly had he first concentrated his mind sitting in dhyana for half a year than he saw the Buddha in samadhi; when he came across an icon along the path, the Buddha appeared in the sky and lit up sky and earth where all became the color of gold: or else, spreading out his kasaya, he bathed in the pool of jewels Having come out of samadhi, he invited the monks to recite sutras (T 2103, k 27, p 304b8-11; transl Demieville, Yogacarabhumi, p 358) The sutras that inspired the association show a certain eclecticism in which the Saddharmapunḍarika, the Sukhavativyuha appeared and, above all, the Pratyutpannasamadhi In his preface to a collection of poetry on the Buddhanusmrtisamadhi published by a member of the association, Houei-yuan declares: The samadhis are very numerous, but in the strength of its merits and ease of access, that of the Buddhanusmrti is foremost (T 2103, k 30, p 351b21) However, Houei-yuan finally had some doubts If, he asked, the Pratyutpannasamadhi is like a dream, the Buddha seen in this samadhi, is he not a simple inner product, an aspect of our consciousness? If so, what value does such a vision have? This is the question he asked Kumarajiva in his exchange of correspondence with the Koutchean master later in the year 406: cf Kieou-mo-lo-che fa cha yi, T 1856, k 2, p 134b4-21 He could not have addressed a better authority <2271> For this correspondence, see R G Wagner, Die Fragen Hui-yüans an Kumarajiva, 1973 In 383 at the capture of Kusha by the armies of the barbarian king Fou Kien of the dynasty of the Later Ts’in (350-394), Kumarajiva was captured by the cavalry general Liu Kouang and forcibly taken to Leang- tcheou in the Kan-sou There he pined away for 19 years (383-401) and kept his profound doctrine to himself, without preaching or converting Finally in 401, another barbarian emperor who was, however, a warm partisan of Buddhism, summoned him This was Yao Hing of the dynasty of the Later Ts’in (384- 417) who reigned from 394 to 416 Kumarajiva, then 57 years of age, arrived at Tch’ang-ngan, the great metropolis of the empire, on February 8, 402 Welcomed warmly by the emperor who put at his disposal hundreds of learned Chinese, Kumarajiva showed unprecedented activity, as much in the translations that he made as in the works that he composed himself On February 1, 406, the date on which the Chinese version of the Traite appeared, Kumarajiva had worked on: 1) A new translation of the Pancavimsatisahasrika (T 223), 2) The abridged translation of the Traite which is its commentary (T 1509) Kumarajiva had brought to Tch’ang-ngan the original Indian of this treatise, entitled in Sanskrit Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa According to the account of his disciple Seng-jouei,he always depended on this Upadesa The work was so voluminous that he was unable to render it in its entirety: he translated fully the first chapter (parivarta), but considerably abridged the 89 following chapters 18793) Two original works dealing with the Kasmirian dhyana as it was practiced in the 4th century of our era: Tso tch’an san-mei king Sutra on the practice of dhyana and samadhi’ (T614), and Tch’en fa yao kiai Brief explanation of the method of dhyana’ (T 616) These two works have been analysed by P Demieville, Yogacarabhumi, p 354-357 The Mo-ho-yen louen (Mahayanopadesa), ie, the Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa (see T 614, k 2, p 278b27; T 616, k 1, p 291b10) has already been cited The knowledge of Kumarajiva extended to the Greater as well as to the Lesser Vehicle; not only was it encyclopedic, but it was also ordered and systematized according to the scholastic procedures of the Abhidharmas to which the Traite grants such an important place And so, as soon as he received Houei- yuan’s letter, shortly after 406, Kumarajiva had no trouble in answering him He wrote: It is necessary to distinguish three kinds of samadhi where one sees the Buddha 1) Some bodhisattvas see him by the divine eye, hear him by the divine ear or fly to the Buddhas of the ten directions 2) Others succeed in this vision without being endowed with the abhijnas by constantly concentrating their mind on Amita and on all the Buddhas of the present 3) Finally, there are some who cultivate the buddhanusmrti proper; some are liberated from desire, others not, and, as a result they see the Buddha either in the form of an icon or in his body of birth’ or also under all the types of all the Buddhas past, future and present These three kinds of concentration are all three correctly called buddhanusmrtisamadhi, but <2272> the first, that which consists of seeing the Buddhas by means of the abhijnas, is better than the others (Ta tch’eng ta yi tchang, T 1856, k 2, p 124b22-28; transl P Demieville, Yogacarabhumi, p 358, note) Here Kumarajiva condenses ad usum Delphini the theories of the Traite concerning the vision of the Buddhas and the controversy in which, in India, the rationalists and the mystics were opposed Nevertheless, he does not go so far as to claim, as does the Traite, that the practice of the divyackasus is easier than the Pratyutpannasamadhi Apart from that, the arguments developed are the same and, in Kumarajiva’s letter, the same technical terms are used as those he had already used in his version of the Upadesa: this is particularly the case for the expression yi-siang-fen-pie, used to render the Sanskrit word samkalpa The profound idea of the Pancavimsati, of the Traite and of Kumarajiva is that the true vision of the Buddhas is that which is practiced in the view of the Prajnaparamita, ie, the one that does not see This why Kumarajiva ends his reply to Houei-yuan with the following conclusion: The Buddha taught the yogacarin what he should think: I have not gone there and that Buddha has not come here to me; however, I have been able to see the Buddha and hear his Dharma’ All of that is only conceptualizing (samkalpa) The things of the threefold world exist as a result of samkalpa; either they are fruits of retribution of thinking of the previous life or products of the thinking of the present life Having heard this teaching, the yogacarin becomes disgusted with the threefold world and increases his faith and respect, saying: The Buddha has enunciated this subtle and admirable system well’ - Then he eliminates the desires of the threefold world, deeply penetrates into samadhi and realizes the [true] Pratyutpanna- samadhi (Ta tch’eng ta yi tchang, T 1856, k 2, p 135a6-11) 1880 Sutra (Pancavimsati, p 30, l 6-13); Satasahasrika, p 96, l 20-104, l 16) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes to see, by means of the divine eye, the Buddhas in each of the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges; if he wishes to hear, by means of the divine ear, all the teachings given by these Buddhas of the ten directions; if he wishes to penetrate [by means of mind] the mind of these Buddhas (Punar aparam Sariputra ye dasasu diksu ganganadivalukopamesu lokadhatusu buddha bhagavatas tan satvan divyena caksusa drastukamena, yams ca te buddha bhagavanto dharman bhasante tan sarvan divyena srotrena srotukamena, tesam ca buddhanam bhagavatam cetasaiva cittam parijnatukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnapamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - I SEEING AND HEARING ALL THE BUDDHAS What is seen by the divine eye (divyacaksus) does not go beyond <2273> one trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu183 But here, by the power of the Prajnaparamita, the bodhisattva sees all the Buddhas in each of the ten directions in universes as many as the sands of the Ganges Why? Because in the view of the Prajnaparamita, nothing is near (samipe), nothing is far (dure), and there is no obstacle (pratigha) to seeing Question - However, in the Pan-tcheou king (Pratyutpannasutra = Pratyutpannabuddha- sammukhavasthitasamadhisutra (Sutra of the concentration during which the Buddhas of the present are face-to-face’), it is said: By the power of the Pratyutpannasamadhi, the ascetic, even without having 183 The range of the divyacaksus varies with the qualities of those who hold it - Kosabhasya, p 429, l 17-430, l 3: Sravakapratyekabuddhabuddhas tv anabhisamskarena sahasradvisahasratrisahasrakan lokadhatun yathasamkhyam pasyanti / adhisamskarena tu sravako pi dvisahasram lokadhatum divyena caksusa pasyati / trisahasram khaḍgavisanakalpah / buddhas tu bhagavan asamkhyeyan lokadhatun pasyati yavad ececchati - Transl - If they do not make an effort, the sravakas, pratyekabuddhas and the Buddha see, with the divine eye, one sahasra universe, one dvisahasra universe, one trisahasra universe, respectively But if they make an effort, the sravakas see, with the divine eye, one dvisahasra universe, and the pratyekabuddhas, one trisahasra universe As for the Blessed Buddha, he sees as many innumerable universes as he wishes 1881acquired the divyacaksus, is able to see all the Buddhas of the present in the ten directions184 On the other hand, here [in the Prajnaparamitasutra], by means of the divyacaksus, the bodhisattva sees all the Buddhas of the tendirections What are the differences between these two visions? Answer - 1) The divyacaksus is non-defiled-indeterminate (anivrtyavyakrta)185 2) The Pratyutpannasamadhi is obtained by a person freed of desire (vitaraga) as well as by a person not freed of desire (avitaraga), whereas the divyacaksus is obtained only by someone freed of desire186 <2274> 3) The Pratyutpannasamadhi is a vision resulting from constant meditation (nityabhavana), the constant practice (nityanisevana) of subjective conceptualizing (samkalpa)187 The divyacaksus, obtained by the practice of the superknowledges (abhijna) is an eye consisting of pure derived matter of the four great elements of the form realm (rupadhatos caturmahabhutany upadaya rupaprasada),188 and this eye enjoys complete luminosity at all four points of the horizon (caturdisa) That is the difference 184 Pratyutpannasamadhisutra, T 418, k 1, p 905a23-27: It is not with the divine eye (divyacaksus) that the bodhisattva-mahasattva sees [the Buddhas of the present, Amita, etc], nor with the divine ear (divyasrotra) that he hears them, nor by the bases of miraculous power (rddhibala) that he goes to their Buddha fields (buddhaksetra) Nor does he see the Buddha by dying here and being reborn over there in the buddhaksetra: on the contrary, it is seated here in one place that he sees the Buddha Amita, hears the sutras preached by him and recollects them all Coming out of samadhi, he still possesses them and preaches them to people Other Chinese versions: T 417, p 899a18-20; T 419, p 922a22-27 185 The divyacaksus and the divyasrotra are part of the six abhijnas (cf p 1809F and foll) As prajna associated with the visual consciousness and the auditory consciousness respectively, these two abhijnas are morally indeterminate, neither good nor bad See Kosabhasya, p 423, l 11: Divyacaksuhsrotrabhijne avyakrte, te punas caksuhsrotravijnanasamprayuktaprajne 186 By its access to the dhyanas of rupadhatu, vitaraga is free of the passions of kamadhatu; avitaraga is the opposite The pratyutpannasamadhi is within the range of all, lay and monastic, whether or not they are free of desire; the divyacaksus is reserved for dhyayins only, detached from kamadhatu 187 The Sanskrit word samkalpa [French: imagination] (conceptualizing) appears frequently in the Madhyamakakarikas and their commentary, the Prasannapada (p 122, l 6; 143, l 11; 350, l 8; 451, l 11); in his translation of the Madhyamakasastra, Kumarajiva always renders samkalpa by the pariphrasis yi-siang-fen-pie (T 1564, k 2, p 13a22- 23; k 3, p 23a25; k 3, p 28b24; k 4, p 31a13) The equivalence has already been noted by H Nakamura, Bukkyßgo Daijiten, I, p 134a Pratyutpannasamadhi is pure autosuggestion, but practice is not useless nevertheless (see above, p 1927- 1928F, note) 188 The divyaskasus is not imaginary: it is an organ made of a pure matter (rupaprasada) derived from the four great elements present in the dhyanas See Kosa, VII, p 123, or Kosabhasya, p 429 18824) The technique (adhikara) of the divyacaksus is easy (sulabha): thus, when the sun has risen, seeing forms (rupa) is not hard (krccha) On the other hand, the technique of the [Pratyutpanna]-samadhi is difficult: thus when one lights a lamp (dipa) in the dark of night, seeing colors (rupa) is not easy189 It is the same for the divine ear (divyasrotra) <2275> II PENETRATING THE MIND OF THE BUDDHAS190 Question - If even a man of weak faculties (mrdvindriya) belonging to a higher stage (uttarabhumi) does not know the mind (citta) of a man with strong faculties (tiksnendriya) belonging to a lower stage (avarabhumi), if even a bodhisattva is unable to know the mind of a single Buddha,191 how then (kah 189 The first five abhijnas, of which divyacaksus is part, rely upon the four dhyanas, ie, are obtained by an ascetic in dhyana (Kosa, VII, p 101) As the Traite has noted above (p 1827F), in the second dhyana the divyacaksus is easy to obtain for the visual consciousness (caksurvijnana) being absent there, the mind is concentrated (samahita) and free of distractions - The practice of the Pratyutpannasamadhi is more complicated In order to attain it, the practitioner must fulfill, during a period of three months of probation, four series of four conditions each (T 417, p 899c9-12; T 418, k 1, p 906a13-28) Then, the moment having come, he enters into concentration proper: Whether he is a monk (sramana) or a lay person (avadatavasana), he thinks constantly of the field (ksetra) of the buddha Amita in the western direction and of the Buddha of that direction, but without forgetting the rules of moral conduct (siksapada) He thinks this way with full attention (ekacittena) either for a day and a night, or for seven days and seven nights At the end of the seven days, he sees the buddha Amita Awakened [from the samadhi], he sees him no longer It is like in dream visions (svapnadarsana) where the sleeper does not know if they are daytime or night-time dreams, internal or external, where there are no shadows (tamas) to prevent seeing, no obstacles (pratigha) to prevent seeing (T 418, k 1, p 905a14-20) - In the corresponding passage of T 417, p 899a9-16, mention is also made of the Buddhas of the present 190 The preceding lines were about abhijna no 5, the cyutupapadajnana, also called divyacaksus, and abhijna no 2, the divyasrotra Now it is a question of abhijna no 3, the cetahparyayajnana, also called paracittajnana, awareness of the mind of another’ The canonical definitions of these three abhijnas have been cited and translated above, p 1809- 1814F By virtue of the paracittajnana, the ascetic, ’by means of his mind, is aware precisely of the minds of others, of other men’ (parasattvanam parapudgalanam cetasaiva cittam yathabhutam prajanati) 191 The limits of the awareness of anopther’s mind are clearly defined in Kosa, VII, p 7 = Kosabhasya, p 393, l 9-12 1) The paracittajnana of a lower dhyana (avaradhyanabhumika) does not know the mind of a higher dhyana (uttaradhyanabhumika) 2) The paracittajnana of a being of weak faculties (mrdvindriya), namely of the sraddhavimukta and the samayavimukta, does not know the mind of a saint of strong faculties (tiksnendriya), namely of the drstiprapta and the asamayavimukta 3) The paracittajnana of a lower saint does not know the mind of a higher saint, in the order, anagamin, arhat, prateykabuddha, Buddha 4) When the mind of another is [past or future (atitanagata), the paracittajnana does not know it, for this jnana has as object the present minds and mental events (vartamanacittacaitta-visayatvat) 1883punarvadah) could the bodhisattva penetrate the mind of all the Buddhas of the ten directions as numerous as the sands of the Ganges’? Answer - The magical power (rddhibala) of the Buddha helps the bodhisattva [to know the mind of all the Buddhas] As the sutra says: Of all beings, there is not one that knows the mind of the Buddha; but if the Buddha, by means of his power, helps one to know it, even insects (krmi) can know it192 This is why <2276> the Buddha helps the bodhisattvas to know the mind of the Buddhas with his magical power[306b] Moreover, the Prajnaparamita has as nature the absence of obstacles (anavaranalaksana) The coarse (audarika) and the subtle (suksma), the profound (gambhira) and the superficial, the fool (bala) and the sage (arya), all are undifferentiated (nirvisista) The suchness (tathata) of the mind of the Buddhas and the suchness of the mind of the bodhisattva are one and the same suchness; they are not different By following this suchness, the bodhisattva is able to penetrate the mind of all the Buddhas Finally, as for these marvelous extraordinary things (ascaryadbhutadharma), it is by not knowing them that one knows them193 This is why the Prajnaparamita says here that the bodhisattva wishing to obtain that should practice the perfection of wisdom Buddhabhasitasamdharana Eight Section RETAINING THE TEACHINGS OF THE BUDDHAS OF THE PRESENT Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 30 l 14-16; Satasahasrika, p 100, l 1-5) - The bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if, after having heard the teachings given in the ten directions by the Buddhas, he wishes to retain everything [and not forget them] until he attains supreme perfect enlightenment - Here the objector invokes the limits of the paracittajnana in order to deny that a bodhisattva knows the mind of the innumerable Buddhas of the present 192 Cf Samghabheda, I, p 196, l 19-25; Divyavadana, p 77, l 14-16; 161, l 23-25; 466, l 10-13: Dharmata khalu yasmin samaya buddha bhagavanto laukikam cittam utpadayanti tada kuntapipilika api praninas tasmin samaye bhagavatas cetasa cittam ajanati; prageva sakrabrahmadayo devah; yasmins tu samaya lokottaram cittam utpadayanti tasmin samaye mahasravaka api bhagavtas cetasa cittam najanati; kah punar vadam sakrabrahmadayo deva; kuta eva kuntapipilika api praninah Transl - It is the rule that at the moment when the Blessed Buddhas produce a worldly mind, even the kuntapipilika insects know the mind of the Blessed One with their own mind, and a fortiori, the gods Sakra, Brahma, etc But when the Buddhas produce a supraworldly mind, even the great disciples cannot know the mind of the Blessed One with their own mind; then what can be said of the kuntapipilika insects? - In PaÈi, kuntapipilika is kunthakipillaka: these are ants 193 Se Panjika cited above, p 2021F: Tattvam prajnaya vivecyamanam sarvadharmanupalambha-laksanam avasitam - Transl - The Absolute, discerned by wisdom, comes down to the non-perception of any dharma whatsoever 1884(Bodhisattvena mahasattvena yams te buddha bhagavato dasasu diksu dharman bhasante tan srutva sarvan samdharayitukamena yavad anuttaram samyaksambodhi, abhisambuddha iti pranaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Question - The teachings of a single Buddha are already hard to retain (samdharayitum); how then would the bodhisattva retain and not forget the teachings of innumerable Buddhas? Answer - By the power of the Srutadharadharani, the dharani retaining what has been heard’,194 the bodhisattva gets a strong memory (smrti) and by the power of the dharani, he does not forget Moreover, as is said here, it is by the power of the Prajnaparamita [that the bodhisattva retains the teachings of all the Buddhas] <2277> Perfectly pure (atyantavisuddhi) and free of any clinging (adhyavasana), this paramita is like the great sea (mahasamudra) which receives all the rivers Similarly, by means of this great receiver (mahabhajana), the Prajnaparamita, the bodhisattva retains and does not forget the innumerable teachings of the Buddhas of the ten directions Finally, the Prajnaparamita is incomparable (anupama) like space (akasa) After the final conflagration (kalpoddaha), a great rain (mahavarsa) fills everything and, except for space, there is no place that can receive it; similarly, when the rain of teachings (dharmadesana) of the Buddhas of the ten directions comes out of the Buddhas’ mouths, there is nobody to retain it except for the bodhisattva practicing the prajnaparamita This is why the Prajnaparamitasutra says here that in order to hear [and retain] the teachings of the Buddhas of the ten directions, the bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom 194 See p 318F, 328F, 1865F 1885 CHAPTER LI: SEEING ALL THE BUDDHA FIELDS First Section SEEING THE FIELDS OF THE BUDDHAS OF THE THREE TIMES Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 39, l 17-18; Satasahasrika, p 100, l 5-8) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes to see the Buddha-fields of the past and future Buddhas, and if he wishes to see the Buddha-fields of the Buddhas existing at the present everywhere in the ten directions (Punar aparam, Sariputra, bodhisattvena mahasattvena atitanam canagatanam ca buddhanam bhagavatam buddhaksetrani drastukamena, pratyutpannanam api samantad dasadiksu buddhanam bhagavatam buddhaksetrani drastukamena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Question - But in seeing the Buddhas of the ten directions (cf p 2272F) the bodhisattva has already seen their Buddha-fields; why speak again here of the bodhisattva who wishes to see the Buddha-fields? Answer - [Above], the bodhisattva had not yet penetrated deeply into the dhyanas and the absorptions (samapatti) and, had he seen the Buddha-fields of the ten directions with their mountains, rivers, plants and trees, his mind would have been distracted (viksipta): this is why he was limited to seeing the Buddhas Everything happened as in the recollection of the Buddha (buddhanusmrti) where it is said (p 1340F) that the yogin sees only the Buddhas but does not see the lands, the mountain, the rivers or the trees Here, on the other hand, the bodhisattva has obtained the power of the dhyanas and the absorptions (samapatti) and is thus able to see as much as he wants (yatheccham), [not only the Buddhas but also the Buddha-fields] Furthermore, the very pure Buddha-fields (parisuddhabuddhaksetra) are difficult to see: this is why the Prajnaparamita says here that if he wishes to see the Buddha-fields, the bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom [306c] Finally, each Buddha possesses hundreds of thousands <2280> of kinds of buddhaksetras As I said before (p 2230F), there are pure (visuddha), impure (avisuddha), mixed (misra) or absolutely pure (atyantaparisuddha) buddhaksetras: since the latter are hard to see (durdrsa), the power of the Prajnaparamita is needed to discover them It is like the devaputra:195 in his audience hall; he can be seen by the people from the outside, but in his private apartments he is not seen by anyone Question - We accept that the buddhaksetras presently existing in the ten directions can be seen; but how could one see the buddhaksetras of the past and future Buddhas? 195 Under the official title of devaputra, the Traite here means the Kusana emperor ruling at its time: cf Traite, Vol III, Introduction, p XI 1886Answer - The bodhisattva possesses the concentration called vision of the past and future’ (atitanagatadarsana); in this concentration he sees things past and future: it is like the visions in a dream (svapnadarsana) Furthermore, the bodhisattva possesses the concentration of unceasing term (anirodhakoti)196 In this concentration, he does not see that the Buddhas have cessation Question - But these two concentrations (samadhi) are not of the eyes (caksus); then how could he see? Answer - These two concentrations are wisdoms (prajna) metaphorically (prajnaptitas) called eye’ Similarly, in the [triple] turning (parivarta) of the Wheel of Dharma (dharmacakra), on [each of the twelve aspects (akara) of the four noble truths (aryasatya), the ascetic obtains the eye’ (caksus), the knowledge (jnana), the clear intuition (vidya), the awareness (buddhi)197 <2281> 196 The anirodhakoti, like the anutpadakoti mentioned above (Pancavimsati, p 29, l 7) is none other than the true nature of dharmas without production or cessation 197 The bodhisattva sees the true nature of things by means of pure wisdom (prajna anasrava) and, even in the earliest texts, this wisdom which in reality sees nothing, is metaphorically called eye’ (caksus) The Wheel of the Dharma is of three turnings and twelve aspects In Sanskrit, triparivartam dvadasakaram dharmacakram (Mahavastu, III, p 333, l 11; Divyavadana, p 205, l 21; 393, l 23; Lalitavistara, p 422, l 2; Astasahasrika, p 380, l 13; Sad Punḍarika, p 179, l 1) In Pali, tiparivattam dvadasakararam yathabhutam nanadassanam (Vinaya, I, p 11, l 20; II, l 25; Samyutta, V, p 422, l 32) The expression is explained in Samyutta, V, p 420-424; Samyukta, T 99, k 15, p 104c-105a; Catusparisad, p 142-152 or 445-446; Dharmaguptaka Vin, T 1428, k 32, p 788a27-b23; Mulasarv Vin, Samghabheda, I, p 135- 136; Mahavastu, III, p 332-333; Lalitavistara, p 417-418; Aloka, p 381-382; Mahavyut, no 1309-1324 The first turning (parivarta) of the noble Truths is the Path of seeing (darsanamarga) and consists of four aspects (akara): 1) This is suffering (idam duhkham); 2) This is its origin (ayam samudayah); 3) This is its cessation (ayam nirodhah); 4) This is the path of the cessation of suffering (iyam nirodhagamini pratipat) The second turning is the path of meditation (bhavanamarga) and consists of four aspects: 1) The noble truth of suffering should be known (duhkham aryasatyam parijneyam); 2) Its origin should be eliminated (duhkhasamudayah prahatavyah); 3) Its destruction should be realized (duhkhanirodhah saksatkartavyah); 4) The path of cessation of suffering should be practiced (duhkhanirodhagamini pratipad bhavayitavya) The third turning is the path of the arhat (asaiksamarga) and consists of four aspects: 1) Suffering is known (duhkham parijnatam); 2) Its origin has been destroyed (samudayah prahinah); 3) Its destruction has been realized (nirodhah saksatkrtah); 4) The path of the cessation of suffering has been practiced (duhkhanirodhagamini pratipad bhavita) After each of the twelve aspects mentioned here, the sources repeat the formula: Purvam ananusrutesu dharmesu yoniso manasikurvatas caksur udapadi, jnanam vidyabuddhir udapadi: When I was meditating on these things not yet understood by me, the eye was born in me, the knowledge, the clear intuition, the awareness were born It is in regard to these four synonyms where the eye is taken in the metaphorical sense of wisdom (prajna) that the Traite is alluding here I [Lamotte} have no doubt that it is a question here of synonyms, although some scholars detect nuances between caksus, jnana, vidya and buddhi: cf Kosavyakhya, p 580, l 30-581, l 6 1887Furthermore, the bodhisattva who sees the buddhaksetras presently existing in the ten directions knows perfectly well that the past (atita) and future (anagata) buddhaksetras are the same as them Why? Because the qualities (guna) of the Buddhas are the same amongst all of them In this regard, see p 2228F Finally, in [the view] of the prajnaparamita, the present (pratyutpanna), the past (atita) and the future (anagata) are the same (sama) and without differences (nirvisista) for it is a matter of one and the same suchness (tathata), one and the same fundamental element (dharmadhatu) This is why you should not argue with us here Dvadasangapravacana Second Section HEARING THE TWELVE-MEMBERED SPEECH OF THE BUDDHA PRELIMINARY NOTE From the evidence of the philosopher and commentator Buddhaghosa, the speech of the Buddha, such as it was presented in Ceylon in the 5th century of our era, was the object of seven different classifications They are listed in the Samantapasadika, p 16; the Sumangalavilasini, p 15; and the Atthasalini, p 18): Tad etam sabbam pi Buddhavacanam rasavasena ekavidham, dhammavinayavasena duvidham, pathamamajjhimapac chimavasena tividham, tatha pitakavasena, nikayavasena pancavidham, angavasena navavidham, dhammakkhandavasena caturasitisahassavidhan ti veditabbam It should be known that the Buddha’s speech is single in its taste, twofold because of the Dharma and the discipline, threefold because of the initial, intermediate and final (words of the Buddha), also threefold because of the baskets, <2282> fivefold because of the collections, ninefold because of the members (anga) and finally 84,000-fold because of the articles of the Dharma The earliest texts mention a classification of the scriptures into members or angas These angas are not literary genres but simply composition types in respect to form (eg, prose or verse) or content (eg, sermons, predictions, stories, conversations, commentaries, etc) The major drawback of this classification is that, far from being mutually exclusive, the angas overlap one another Thus a sutra is also a geya if it contains verse, a gatha if it is expressed in stanzas, an udana if it includes exclamations, an ityuktaka if it begins or ends with certain stereotyped formulas, a jataka if it tells about previous lifetimes, a vyakarana if it contains explanations or predictions, etc The Pali sources list nine members: the Sanskrit-Chinese sources usually mention twelve; the classification into nine members is called Navanga, the classification into twelve members, Dvadasanga A Hirakawa has dedicated a masterful study to the Dvadasanga in his work Shoki daijß no Kenyu (Study on the early Mahayana), 1968, p 721-753 Previously he had condensed his ideas into an article entitled 1888The Rise of Mahayana Buddhism in Memoirs of the Research Department of the Tßyß Bunko, no 22 (1963), p 61-65 In the canonical sources, whether they are nine or twelve in number, the angas are set out without any explanation They are supposed to include the entirety of the Buddhist scriptures, but they could also be applied to any other literature, sacred as well as profane This type of classification is not necessarily Buddhist in origin and could be derived from literary concepts widespread in the early centuries of Buddhism This would explain the hesitation that commentators will always feel when they have to define any anga in particular 1 The Navanga Throughout their history, the Theravadins have maintained the division of the scriptures into nine angas, cited in Pali in the following order: 1) sutta, 2) geyya, 3) veyyakarana, 4) gatha, 5) udana, 6) itivuttaka, 7) jataka, 8) abbhutadhamma, 9) vedalla The canonical and paracanonical texts list these angas without trying to define them: Vinaya, III, p 8 Majjhima, I, p 133-134; Anguttara, II,p 7, 103, 178; III, p 86, 88, 177, 361, 362; IV, p 113; Mahaniddesa, I, p 143; Cullaniddesa, p 192 Puggalapannatti, p 43, 62 Milindapanha, p 344, l 3 (navangasasana) As we have seen, the other Buddhist schools preferred the list of twelve members: the Dvadasanga (in Chinese che eul pou king or che eul fen kiao); and the Sanskrit-Chinese sources exceptionally mention the Navanga (kieou pou king or kieou fen kiao) also <2283> 1 The Navanga are mentioned in some rare canonical sutras translated into Chinese: Parinirvana, T 7, k 1, p 194b8; Samgiti, T 12, k 1, p 227b26-27; Angulimala, T 120, k 2, p 524a28; Itivrttaka, T 765, k 5, 684a3-4: k 7, p 607c17-18 2 The Mahasamghika Vinaya, like the Pali Vinaya, counts only nine angas: T 1425, k 1, p 227b12-13; k 7, p 281c18-20; k 16, p 356c10-13 In the Mahayanist sutras and sastras, the Navanga is the exception, except when it is a matter of contrasting the Hinayanist Navanga with the Mahayanist Dvadasanga 3 The Saddharmapunḍarika proposes a navanga (p 46, l 1) different from the Pali classification, which consists of (p 45, l 7-8): 1) sutra, 2) gatha, 3) itivrttaka, 4) jataka, 5) adbhuta, 6) nidana, 7) aupamya, 8) geya, 9) upadesa 1889The Chinese versions faithfully translate these passages (cf T 262, k 1, p 7c25-27 and p 8a6; T 264, k 1, p 140c16-18 and 26), but a few pages later, refer to the Dvadasanga (cf T 262, k 4, p 34b3; T 264, k 4, p 168c12) 4 Two Mahayanist treatises, traditionally attributed to Nagarjuna and both translated by Kumarajiva, the Upadesa (T 1509) and the Dasabhumikavibhasa (T 1521) disagree on the number of the angas: the Upadesa counts twelve, the Vibhasa, nine (T 1521, k 2, p 29b3; k 3, p 35b16; k 6, p 50b17; k 9, p 69b26-28) 5 For the Mahayanist Mahaparinirvanasutra, the Navanga represents the Hinayanist Buddhism which is but the semi-speech of the Buddha (T 374, k 3, p 383c6-9; k 5, pl 391a9; k 7, p 404a5; T 375, k 3, p 623b25-27; k 5, p 63a14; k 7, p 644c9), whereas the Dvadasanga is supposed to contain the entirety of the Buddha’s speech held by the Mahayana (T 374, k 15, p 451b15-18; T 375, k 14, p 693b16-19) 2 The Dvasasanga The division of the scriptures into twelve angas is largely predominant in the Buddhism of the Sanskrit language, both Hinayana and Mahayana, and the twelve members are often cited in the following manner, that of the Mahavyutpatti (no 1267-1278): 1) sutra, 2) geya, 3) vyakarana, 4) gatha, 5) udana, 6) nidana, 7) avadana, 8) itivrttaka, 9) jataka, 10) vaipulya, 11) adbhutadharma, 12) upadesa Three members are added to the preceding list: nidana, introduction showing the circumstances incidental to the speech; avadana, story of a feat; upadesa, systematic instruction Two words have been sanskritized: vedalla, of obscure meaning, has been replaced here by vaipulya, developed text’; itivuttaka thus has it been said’ is sanskritized as ityuktaka, having the same meaning, or hyper-sanskritized as itivrttaka thus has it happened Ityuktaka is vouched for, with an error of spelling, in the Satasahasrika, p 100, l 10; 1460, l 5 Itivrttaka occurs more frequently: cf Sanskrit Mahaparnirvana, p 386, l 2; Kosavyakhya, p 438, l 30; Pancavimsatisah, p 31, l 5; 158, l 13; 218, l 13; Saddharmapunḍarika, ed Kern <2284> -Nanjio, p 45,l 7 and Kashgar version, ed H Toda, II-III, p 329, l 30;

they were careful not to define them, undoubtedly because they had only a very vague notion of them Starting from the 2nd century of our era, the scholars attempted to explain the angas, but their interpretations lack coherence and their hesitations betray their embarrassment On this subject see the masterly work of E Mayeda, A History of the Formation of Original Buddhist Texts 1964 In regard to the twelve angas, the commentaries furnished by the following works are taken into account: <2285> 1 Abhidharmamahavibhasasastra, T 1545, k 126, p 659c8-660b7 2 Mahaprajnaparamitasutropadesa,T 1509, k 33, p306c16-308b17;

the second column from the Tibetan version, Tib Trip, vol 18, no 731, p 55, fol 37b3-4; the third from the Chinese translation of Kumarajiva, T 223, k 1, p 220b25-28; the fourth from the Chinese translation of Hiuan-tsang, T 220 (vol VII), k 402, p 9c26-28i 1 sutra, mdo, sieou to lo (K), k’i king (H) 2 geya, dbyans kyis bsnad pa, k’i ye, (K), ying song (H) 3 vyakarana, lun bstan pa, cheou ki (K), cheou ki (H) 4 gatha, tshigs su bcad pa, k’ie t’o, (K), fong song (H) 5 udana, ched du brjod pa, yeou t’o na (K), tseu chou (H) 6 nidana, glen gzi, yin yuan (K), yin yuan (H) 18927 avadana, rtogs pa brjod pa, apo t’o na (K), p’i yu (H) 8 ityuktaka, - , jou che yu king (K), -  itivrttaka, hdi ltar hdas pa, yi mou (tchou) to kia (K), pen che (H) 9 jataka, skyes pahi rabs, pen cheng (K), pen cheng (H) 10 vaipulya, sin tu rgyas pa, kouang king (K), fang kouang (H) - , - , p’i fo lio (K), -  11 adbhutadhaarma, rmad du byun bahi chos, wei ts’ewng yeou king (K), hi fa (H) 12 upadesa, gtan la dbab par bstan pa, louen yi (K), louen yi (H) - , - , yeou po t’i chö (K), -  Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 31, l 4-8;

there were only bhiksus who were specialists in the sutras (sutradhara), specialists in the discipline (vinayadhara) or specialists in catechesis (matrkadhara) Sutra’ is the name of the sacred texts found in the four Agamas (agamacatustaya) and the name of the sacred texts found in the Mahayana The sutras are of two groups: the sutras contained in the four Agamas and the Mahayansutras called Great Sutras To penetrate into these two groups is to penetrate into the Greater and Lesser Vehicles also The 250 precepts (siksapada) and similar texts are called sutra’ - The Traite recognizes as canonical and calls sutra’ the texts contained in the four Agamas or the Agamacatustaya of which the Sarvastivadin sources speak (cf Divyavadana, p 17, l 22; 333, l 8), the Mahayanasutras rejected by the Hinyana sects and some disciplinary texts such as the 250 precepts’ making up the first three song of the Sarvastivadin Vinaya (T 1435): cf above, p 104F, n 2 Buddhaghosa will likewise place the Suttavibhanga of the Vinayapitaka among the suttas 201 Vyakarana can designate a catechesis by means of questions and answers, an explanation or a prediction The Traite here holds only this latter meaning When the Buddha is about to give a prediction, he smiles and multicolored rays are emitted from his upper and lower canine teeth which light up the beings of the three unfortunate destinies and the two happy destinies, proclaiming the three seals of the Dharma and making conversions Thus doing the work of the Buddha, the rays return to the Buddha and, according to whether they have announced such and such an attaining of Bodhi, they re-enter the Buddha by such and such a part of his body Witnessing these miracles, Ananda asks the Buddha about their meaning and the Teacher gives him their explanation The predictions that the Buddha was led to give were numerous They always unfolded according to the rituals that have just been summarized In order to describe them, the texts, particularly those of the Sarvastivadins, always use the same stock phrase: cf Divyavadana, p 67, l 16-69; 138, l 1-140, l 7; 265, l 16-267, l 7; Samghabheda, II, p 161, l 21-163, l 20; Avadanasataka, I, p 4, l 5-7, l 6; 10, l 5-12, l 20; 19, l 1-22, l 5, etc - This stock phrase has already been given above, p 460F, n 2 18944-9) He predicts that the beings belonging to one of the six other destinies [naraka, tiryanc, preta, manusya, deva, asura], in the future lifetime equally, will obtain their retribution (vipaka) [The prediction takes place in the following manner]: [307a] 1) For the Buddha, it is the rule that, at the moment when he is going to give the prediction (vyakarana) to a being, he first smiles (purvam smitam praviskaroti), then immense rays (arcis) shoot forth from his four canine teeth (damstra): blue (nila), yellow (pita), red (lohita), white (avadata), bright red (manjistha), etc rays 2) The rays that stream forth from his two upper canine teeth illumine the three bad destinies (durgati) - [naraka, tiryanc and preta] - and, from these rays immense preachings (dharmadesana) spread out proclaiming: All formations are impermanent, all dharmas are without self, peaceful is nirvana (sarvasamskara anityah, sarvadharma anatmanah, santam nirvanam) The beings who encounter these rays and hear this preaching find happiness of body and mind (kayacittasukha), will be reborn among humans (manusya) and gods (deva) and, as a result, will come to the end of suffering (duhkhasyanta) 3) The rays that stream forth from his two lower canines go upwards (uparistad gacchanti) to illuminate humans (manusya) and gods <2289> (deva) up to the absorption of the summit of existence (bhavagrasamapatti): a The deaf (badhira), the blind (andha) and the mute (mukha), the mentally disturbed (unmatta) and the sick (rogasprsta) are cured b The six [classes] of gods of the desire realm (satkamadeva), humans (manusya), asuras, enjoying all the happiness of the five objects of enjoyment (pancakamaguna), as soon as they come in contact with the Buddha’s rays and perceive the sounds (sabda) of the preaching of the Dharma (dharmadesana), are seized by horror (vidusana) in regard to the sense pleasures and find happiness of body and mind (kayacittasukha) c As for the gods of the form realm (rupadhatudeva), the ones who are enjoying the happiness of the dhyanas (dhyanasukha), as soon as they come in contact with the Buddha’s rays and perceive the sounds of the preaching of the Dharma, they are seized with disgust [for the taste of the dhyanas] (dhyanasvadana)] and go to the Buddha 4) This goes on while the rays have gone to the ten directions and have illuminated the six destinies (saḍgati) everywhere Having thus done the work of the Buddha (buddhakarya), they return to the Buddha, make seven circuits around his body and [are reabsorbed into him] a If the Buddha predicts a birth among the damned (narakapapatti), the rays re-enter him by the soles of his feet (padatale ntardhiyante) b If the Buddha predicts a birth among the animals (tiryagupapatti), the rays re-enter through his heel (parsnyam antaradhiyante) c If the Buddha predicts a birth among the pretas (pretopatti), the rays re-enter through his big toe (padangusthe ntardhiyante) 1895d If the Buddha predicts a birth among humans (manusyopapatti), the rays re-enter by his navel (nabhyam antardhiyante) e If the Buddha predicts a birth among the gods (devopatti), the rays re-enter by his chest (urasy antardhiyante) f If the Buddha announces [the bodhi] of the sravakas the rays re-enter by his mouth (asye ntardhiyante) g If the Buddha announces [the bodhi] of the pratyekabuddhas, the rays re-enter by the [tuft of white hairs] between his eyebrows (urnayam antardhiyante) h If the Buddha announces [the sambodhi] of the Buddhas, the rays re-enter by his cranial protuberance (usnise ntardhiyante) 5) When the Buddha makes a prediction (vyakarana), he first manifests these signs, then his disciples, Ananda, etc, question him as to their meaning <2290> IV GATHA All the kie verses’, if they are composed of six, three or five metric feet (pada) or an undetermined number of metric feet, are called k’i-ye geya’ and also k’ie-to, gatha, stanza’the V UDANA202 202 In general, any literary composition where, under the influence of joy or sadness, an exclamation’ is uttered, most often in the form of gatha, can be called udana Here the Traite is going to use as example a sutta from the Samyutta (III, p 55-58) entitled precisely Udana; but the examples may be infinitely multiplied, as the expression udanam udanayati to utter and exclaim’ is often met in the canonical texts The exclamation is not always made by the Buddha: it may also be uttered by the deities or by the disciples But udana can also designate a given Buddhist work: for example, a collection of verses compiled after the Buddha’s parinirvana dealing with the grand subjects of the religion This collection had been divided into chapters (varga), the first dealing with impermanence (anitya) and the last with the brahmana This brief description can be applied only to the Udana of Eastern Turkestan, one of the minor texts classified by the Sarvastivadins into the special collection of the Ksudrakagama or Ksudrakapitaka (cf Mulasarv Vin, Gilgit Manuscripts, III, part 4, p 188, l 8; T 1448, k 3, p 11b6; Divyavadana, p 20, l 23; 34, l 29; Samyuktagama, T 99, k 49, p 362c10 This Udana of the North, according to F Bernhard’s edition (1965), consisted of 33 chapters, the first of which is entitled Anityavarga and the last, Brahmanavarga In the west, this work has long been designated under the title of Udanavarga, but F Bernhard has shown that udanavarga is a common name meaning the vargas (chapters) of the Udana’, and that the work was really called Udana (Zum Titel des sogenannten Udanavarga, Sonderdruck der ZDMG, Supplementa I, 1969, p 872-881) With the Dharmapada which is similar to it, the Udana was the object of a Tibetan translation (Otani Kanjur Catalogue, no 992) and four Chinese versions or adaptations (T210 to 213); see L Schmithausen, Zu den Rezensionen des Udanavargah, Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde Sudasiens, XIV (1970), p 47-124); C Willemen, The Chinese Udanavarga, 1978, p XIII-XXVIII 18961) The yeou-t’o-na (udana) exclamations’ are called yeou-fa203 When the Buddha needed to speak and nobody <2291> was questioning him, he elicited a question by a short exclamation [Udanasutra]204 - Thus the Buddha was at Sravasti, at the Visakhaprasada, and was walking in the shade [Suddenly] he uttered this exclamation (udanam udanayati sma): That there is no me’ (atman), that there is no mine’ (atmiya), how wonderful (sadhu)! Then a certain bhiksu, joining his palms together (anjakim pranamya), said to the Buddha: Bhagavat, that there is no me, that there is no mine, why is that a good thing? <2292> The Traite is going to talk about the yao-kie summary verses’ of this Udana But the work contains only rare summary-stanzas, in Sanskrit uddana (ed Bernhard, p184, 277, 510) As a result of homophony, confusion between udana and uddana was inevitable, but udana comes from the root ud-an to expire upwards’ whereas uddana is derived from the root ud-da (dayati) to join, to condense’ 203 Here yeou-fa probably renders the typical exclamation aho dharmam Ah! The Dharma! which appears several times in the Mahavastu, I, p 236, l 18; 237, l 3; 241, l 12; II, p 143, l 18; 406, l 11: aho dharmam udirayensuh The expression already appeared in the fourth Rock Edict of Asoka (ed J Bloch, Inscriptions d’Asoka, p 98): bherighoso aho dhammaghoso, which is to be translated not as the sound of the drums has become (aho, imperfect of hoti) the announcement of the Dharma, but as the sound of the drums and the cheering of Ah! the Dharma! according to the interpretation of L de La Vallee Poussin, L’Inde aux temps des mauryas, 1930, p 110) Gods and humans often utter the exclamation O happiness! (udanam udanenti Aho sukhan ti’); cf Digha, III, p 218; l 23-24; Anguttara, III, p 202, l 13; Pali Udana, p 18, l 22-23 204 Udanasutta in Samyutta, III, p 55-58; Samyukta, T 99, no 64, k 3, p 16c4-17a20, of which the following is an extract: Savatthiyam Tatra kho bhagava udanam udanesi: No c’assam na me siya / na bhavassati na me bhaissati ti / evam adhimuccamano bhikkhu / chindeyy’ orambhagiyani samyojanani ti //  The general idea of the sutra is that by destroying the twenty-peaked mountain of satkayadrsti (considering rupa as identical with the atman, etc), the ascetic escapes from the fear (trasa) which the doctrine of non-self inspires in the non-initiated, and destroys the five lower’ fetters (avarabhagiya) binding him to the lower realm, ie, to kamadhatu The stanza No c’assam, etc, cited here according to the Commentary of the Samyutta, II, p 275, is obscure Buddhaghosa explains it as: Sace aham na bhaveyyam mama parikkharo pi na bhaveyya Sace va pana me atite kammabhisankharo nabhavissa, idam me etarahi khandhapancakam na bhaveyya - If I myself were not, the unessential would not be in me either Or rather: If, in the past, there had not been a karmic process on my part, the group of the five aggregates would not exist for me today In his Chinese version of the Samyukta (T 99, k 3, p 16c8-10), Gunaprabha renders the stanza as follows: If there is no me’ (atman), neither is there any mine’ (atmiya); if there truly is no me’, where would the mine’ come from? The bhiksu who accepts that destroys the lower fetters (avarabhagiya samyojana) 1897The Buddha answered the bhiksu: The worldly person (prthagjana) who has not obtained the bodhi without impurities (anasrava bodhi) and whose mind is covered with doubts (viparyasa), feels great fear (trasa) in regard to non-self (anatman) and non-mine’ (anatmiya) But if the Buddha or a disciiple of the Buddha teaches him the holy Dharma (saddharma), then he rejoices and obeys because, no longer having fear, there is no problem - This sutra is told in full in the Samyuktagama 2) Furthermore, as is said in the Prajnaparamitaparivarta,205 the devaputras applauded Subhuti on one occasion, exclaiming: Good! Very good! Very rare is the Blessed One; exceptionally rare is the appearance of the Blessed One! - That [307b] also is called udana 3) Furthermore, after the parinirvana of the Buddha, his disciples gathered and copied yao-kie summary verses’ (uddana?); verses about impermanence made up the chapter on impermanence (anityavarga) and so on up to the verses on the brahmana which made up the chapter on the brahmana (brahmanavarga) - That also is called udana206 4) The collections of wonderful things are also called udana Texts of this kind show the characteristics of the udanas VI NIDANA207 1) The nidanas set out the circumstances (nidana) that are at the origin of the Buddha’s teachings Under what circumstances did the Buddha say a certain thing? In the sutras, it is because a man asked him that he said a certain thing; in the Vinaya, it is because a man <2293> committed a certain wrong-dong (adhyacara) that he promulgated a certain rule (siksapada) 2) The facts of dependent origination (pratityasamutpada) set forth by the Buddha are also called nidana 205 Later (k 40, p 353b18; k 53, p 441b2), mention will be made of this Prajnaparamita-parivarta although this title does not appear in the table of contents of T 223 The Traite is referring here to a passage from the Pancavimsati, T 223, k 14, p 325b, chap XLIX entitled Wen-siang-p’in The same passage occurs in the Astasahasrika, ed Wogihara, p 560: Atha khalu Sakradevendrapramukhah kamavacara rupavacaras ca devaputra brahmakayikanam ca vimsatidevaputrasahasani yena Bhagavams tenopasamkramya Bhagavatah padau sirasabhivandyaikante tasthuh / ekantasthitas ca te kamavacara rupavacaras ca devaputra Bhagavantam etad avocan / gambhira Bhagavan dharmah prakasyante katham Bhagavann atra laksanani sthapyante 206 For the author of the Traite, the group called udana’ is represented by the Sanskrit Udana of Eastern Turkestan consisting of 3 vargas, the first of which deals with anitya and the last with the brahmana For Buddhaghosa (Commentary on the Vinaya, I, p 28,) it is represented by the 82 suttantas of the Pali Udana 207 Here nidana is taken with two different meanings: i) the circumstances of time, place and people in which a sutra was preached or a rule (siksapada) was promulgated; ii) the series of the twelve conditions determining the dependent origination of phenomena 1898VII AVADANA The avadanas stories’ are amusing little tales (mrdukatha) such as there are among people in the world For example: In the Madhyagama: the Tch’ang a-po-t’o-na (Dirghavadana);208 In the Dirgagama: the Ta a-po-t’o-na (Mahavadana),209 In the Vinaya: the Yi-eul a-po-t’o na (Kotikarnavadana)210 and the Eul-che-yi a-po-t’o-na (Kotivimsavadana),211 In the two hundred and fifty rules (siksapada): the Yu a-po-t’o-na (Chandavadana) in one book and the P’ou-sa a-po-t’o-na (Bodhisattvavadana) in one book212 There are innumerable avadanas of this kind VIII ITYUKTAKA213 The sutras called Jou-che-yu (Ityuktaka) thus has it been said’ are of two kinds: <2294> 1) The first kind are those sutras having as their concluding phrase (kie-kiu214): What I first promised to say has been said215 208 Dirghayurajavadana of the Madhyamagama, no 72, T 26, k 17, p 532c539b; Upakkilesasutta of the Majjhimanikaya, no 128, III, p 152-162 209 Mahavadana (ed E Waldschmidt, 19523) of the Dirghagama, vol 1, T 1, k 1, p 1b-10c; Mahapadanasuttanta of the Dighanikaya, no 14, II, p 1-54 210 For the Kotikarnavadana, see references mentioned above, p 546F, n 3 and the study by E Waldschmidt, Zur Sronakotikarna-Legende, in Von Ceylan bis Turfan, p 203-225 211 For Srona Kotivimsa already mentioned several times (p 1387F, 1681F, 1894F) see references to the Vinayas, p 1389F, n The original Sanskrit of the avadana in the Mulasarv Vin is in Samghabheda, II, p 1340147, corresponding to T 1450, k 16, p 184b26; k 17, p187b15 See also E Waldschmidt, Ein Beitrag zur Überlieferung vom Sthavira Srona Kotivimsa, Melanges d’indianisme á memoire de Louis Renou, 1968, p 773-787; A contribution to our knowledge of Sthavira Srona Kotivimsa, in S K De Memorial Volume, 1972, p 107-116 212 For the avadanas of Chanda and the bodhisattva, see A Hirakawa, Ritzuzö no kenkyu, 1960, p 389-394 and 398- 402 These two individuals appear in the Vibhangas of various Vinayas, but it does not seem that special sections (pou) were devoted to them 213 The ityuktaka thus has it been said’ and the itivrttaka thus has it happened’ correspond to the Pali itivittaka The Traite distinguishes the two forms, and Kumarajiva, in the Chinese version, translates the first as jou-che-yu-king and transliterates the second as yi-mou (var tchou)-to kia, abbreviated as mou-to-kia There are other ways of transliterating itivrttaka (cf Mochizuki, Bukkyo daijiten, I, p 166) the best seems to have been yi-ti-yue-to-kia (cf T 374, k 3, p 383c7; T 397, k 11, p 69c27-28) 214 In terms of this definition, the ityuktaka strictly speaking would be a sutra where this concluding phrase appears, or also a collection of such sutras as, for example, the Ityuktakasutra translated into Chinese by Hiuan-tsang under the title 18992) The second kind is that of the sutras called Yi-mou (variant tchou)-to-kia, ie, itivrttaka thus did it happen’, a type of sutra also existing outside of (or extracted from) the Tripitaka and the Mahayanasutras Some people call them Mou-to-kia, ie, vrttaka event’; this name, vrttaka, is that of texts extracted from the Tripitaka and the Mahayansutras216 And what is it then? It is what the Buddha said <2295> of Pen-che king (T 765) Nevertheless, the phrase of conclusion mentioned in the Traite is not the rule: on the other hand, all the sutras occurring in this collection begin with the phrase I myself have heard this ityuktaka from the Bhagavat Also, in his commentary on the Vinaya, I, p 28, Buddhaghosa calls itivuttaka the 112 suttas which begin with the formula: This has been spoken by the Blessed One, has been spoken by the Saint: thus have I heard (vuttam hetam Bhagavata vuttam arahata ti me sutam) The 112 suttas in question constitute the collection of itivuttakas making up the fourth place in the fifth Pali Nikaya 215 In terms of this definition, the ityuktaka proper wojuld be a sutra in which this concluding phrase appears, or else a collection of such sutras, as, eg, the Ityuktakasutra translated intom Chinese by Hiuan-tsang under the name of Pen- che king (T 765) Nevertheless, the phrase of conclusion mentioned in the Traite is not a rule; on the other hnd, all the sutras occurring in this collection begin with the phrase: I myself have heard this ityuktaka from the Bhagavat Also, in his Commentary on the Vinaya, I, p 28, Buddhaghosa calls itivuttaka the 112 suttas that begin with the formula: This was spoken by the Blessed One, spoken by the Saint: this is how it was heard by me (vuttam hetam Bhagavata vyttam arahata ti me sutam) The 112 suttas innquestion make up the collection of the itivuttaka occupying the fourth place in the fifth Pali Nikaya 216 Itivrttaka is, in the etymological sense of the word, the story of an event, but it would be nice to know how it differs from an avadana or a jataka According to Asanga, the itivrttaka relates the earlier existences of the noble disciples whereas the jatakas tell the earlier existences of the Bodhisattva (Abhidharmasamuccaya, transl Rahula, p 132) Samghabhadra, in his Nyayanusara, T 1562, k 44, p 595a, gives another explanation which E Mayeda, in a study entitled Original Meaning of irivuttaka as an anga of navangabuddhasÔana, summarizes thus: I have defined itivrttaka as a kind of story in the previous world that begins in the previous world and ends in the previous world’ on the ground of the explanation of Chinese A-p’i-ta-mo-chouen-tcheng-li-louen (vol 44) In the same commentary jataka is defined as a kind of story that begins in the present world and ends in the previous world’ Owing to this explanation, we can easily distinguish itivrttaka from jataka Jataka was one kind of itivrttaka originally It is remarkable that we cannot find the word itivrttaka’ (or itivuttaka’ with the meaning of itivrttaka) in the Early Buddhist texts in general except in the case of navangabuddhasasana From this reason I can suppose with certainty that the story in the previous world was avadana Neither the Mahavibhasa nor the Traite entered into these distinctions In the present passage, the Traite is content to give an example of itivrttaka The sacred literature abounds in sentences and stanzas attributed to the Buddha or his disciples Often one hesitates over the meaning to give them, for one does not know the circumstances in which they were pronounced or the reasons that provoked them The itivrttaka takes on the responsibility of giving them a context: if the Buddha expressed himself thus’, it is because the circumstances occurred thus’ These events were not invented: they can be found in the Tripitaka and the Mahayanasutras’ But the choice is rather difficult and it happens that the event that is told in prose gives only an inadequate and forced explanation of the stanza The fact remains that it is extracted’ from the Tripitaka and in that capacity it is a speech of the Buddha 1900[Example of itivrttaka] When king Tsing-fan (Suddhodana] forced [some of his subjects] to go forth from home (pravraj-) and become disciples of the Buddha,217 the latter chose five hundred of them capable of fulfilling this function and of attaining bodhi and led them to Sravasti Why? These young men had not yet renounced desire (avitaraga) and, if they had remained near their relatives and their village, it was to be feared that they would violate the precepts (sila) This is why the Buddha took them to Sravasti and told Sariputra and Maudgalyayana to discipline them During the first and last watches (yama) of the night, these people endeavored not to sleep and, thanks to their diligence and exertion (virya), they attained bodhi When they had attained bodhi, the Buddha took them back to their native country It is a rule among all the Buddhas to return to their native land;218 then the Buddha, accompanied by a great crowd of devas, went to Kapilavastu, in the Hermit’s Forest (Ṛsivana) which is located five hundred lis from, Kapilavastu: it is the pleasure garden (arama) of the Sakyas The Sakya bhiksus who, from their stay in Sravasti, tried not to sleep during the first and third watches of the night, found the night long and now, coming out of the Hermit’s Forest in order to go to the city to beg alms, they took into account the distances they had to travel At the moment when the Buddha read their minds, a lion (simha) came to bow at the feet of the Buddha and sat down at one side219 For these three reasons, the Buddha spoke the following stanza: <2296> For the person who stays awake, the night is long; [307c] For the person who is tired, the league is long; For the fool who misunderstands samÔara The Holy Dharma is long220 The stanza which the itivrttaka gives here as an example is taken from the Udanavarga (I, v 19) corresponding to the Dhammapada (v 60) The Commentary of the Dhammapada (II, p 1-12) suggests quite another explanation (cf E W Burlingame, Buddhist Legends, part 2, p 100-108) 217 On the forced ordination of 500 young Sakya men, see above, p 176-177F n, and p 869F, n 1 See also Samghabheda, I, p 203-204 218 The Buddha’s return to Kapilavastu, his native city, is told in detail in the Mahavastu, III, p 101-117; the Samghavastu, I, p 187 seq; the Nidanakatha, p 87 seq It is represented at Sanchi (Marshall and Foucher, Monuments of Sanchi, I, p 204-205, pl 50a1) and on the bas-reliefs of Gandhara (Foucher, AgbG, I, p 459-464) 219 This was a brahmana who, at the time of the Buddha Vipasyin, had wickedly (cittapradusanena) insulted the Community This insult was an action ending up in animal rebirths (tiryagyonyupattisamvartaniya) For five hundred lifetimes, the brahmana was reborn among the lions (simhesupapanna) 220 Udanavarga, I, v 19 (ed F Bernhard, p 102) cited in the Mahakarmavibhnga (ed S Levi, p 46): dirgha jagarat ratrir dirgham srantasya yojanam / dirgho balasya samsarah saddhram avijanatah // Dhammapada, v 60 at the Balavagga: digha jagarato ratti digham santassa yojanam / 1901The Buddha said to the bhiksus: Before you went forth from the world (pravrajya), your mind was lazy (pramatta) and you slept a lot; this is why you did not perceive the length of the night Now that you are vigorously seeking bodhi, during the first and third watches of the night, you are reducing your sleep; this is why you find the night very long - Previously, it was in a chariot that you rode in the forests of Kapilavastu and you did not notice the distances Now that you are in monks’ robes (civara) with begging- bowl (patra) in hand, your fatigue (srama) is extreme and you take into account the length of the path - Finally, this lion here, at the time of the buddha Vipasyin, was a brahamana teacher Having heard that the Buddha was preaching the Dharma, he went to the Buddha, but at that moment the great assembly who were listening to the Dharma were silent At once the brahmana had a wicked thought (pradustacitta) and uttered this harmful speech (parusyavada): How are these shaven-headed people (mundaka) different from animals? They are nothing but idiots (devanampriya)221 who don’t know how to talk As a result of this harmful action of speech (parusyavada), for ninety-one kalpas, from the buddha Vipasyin until now, this brahmana has always fallen into animal rebirths (tiryagyoniyupatti); but at this very moment he obtains bodhi By his foolishness, he has gone through a very long samsara; however, today in the presence of the Buddha, his mind has been purified and he will obtain deliverance (vimukti) - Sutras of this kind are called extracts and reasons’ From where <2297> are they extracted? They are called extracts because they are taken from the Tripitaka and the Mahayana sutras Why are they called reasons’? Because the three events that they tell about serve as justification IX JATAKA Stories of previous lives: [The lion, the monkey and the vulture]222 digho balanam samsaro saddhammam avijanatam // 221 Hao-jen, honest man’ is taken here in the pejorative sense of imbecile’ or idiot’ Shifts of analogous meaning are attested in many unrelated languages On this subject, see M Hara, A note on the Sanskrit Phrase Devanam priya, Katre Felicitation Volume, part II, p13-26, Indian Linguistics, Vol 30 (1969) 222 A longer verson of this jataka occurs in the Sagaramatibodhisattvasutra, translated into Chinese at Kou-tsang between 414 and 421 by the Indian Dharmaksema, and later, in 594, incorporated into the Collection of the Mahasamnipata of which it makes up the fifth section: T 594, k 11, p 70a23-b18: Long ago, there was a lion-king (simharaja) living in a deep mountain cave He always had the thought: Among all the animals I am the king; I am able to watch over and protect all the animals Then, on that mountain, a pair of monkeys (kapi, markata) bore two babies One day the monkeys said to the lion-king: O king who protects all the animals, today we entrust to you our two little ones; we would like to go to look for food and drink The lion-king promised to help them, and the monkeys, leaving their two little ones with the king of the animals, went away At that time, there was, on the mountain, a vulture-king (grdhraja) called Li-kien Keen Sight’ (Tiksnadarsana?) While the lion-king was sleeping, he took away the two little monkeys and went to perch on a cliff Having awakened, the lion-king addressed the following stanza to the vulture-king: Here I send a prayer to the great vulture-king 1902Once (bhutapurvam) the Bodhisattva was a lion (simha) living in the forest He was joined in friendship with a monkey (kapi, markata) The monkey <2298> entrusted his two little ones to the lion Then there came along a famished vulture (grdhra) in search of food Finding the lion asleep, he stole the two little monkeys and went to perch at the top of a tree When the lion awoke, he searched for the babies and did not find them Seeing the vulture at the top of the tree, he said: The monkey had entrusted his two babies to me, but while I was watching them, I was not careful; this is how you took them away and now you have My only wish is that he magnanimously grant my prayer: May he very kindly release these little ones May I not be ashamed at having failed in my promise The vulture-king replied to the lion-king with this stanza: By flying, I can pass through space Already I have passed through your realm and I am not afraid If you truly must protect these two little ones, You must give up your body to me The lion-king said: Now, in order to protect these two little ones I give up my body unsparingly like some rotten grass If I break my word in order to save my life, How could it be said that I am faithful to my promise? Having spoken this stanza, the lion climbed up with the intention of jumping off the cliff At once the vulture-king answered with this stanza: The man who sacrifices his life for another Will attain the supreme happiness (anuttarasukha) Now I give you back the two baby monkeys May the king of the Dharma not do any harm [Then the Buddha said to the bodhisattva Sagaramati]: O son of noble family, the lion at that time was me; the male monkey was Kasyapa; the female monkey was the bhiksuni Bhadrapala; the two baby monkeys were Ananda and Rahula; the vulture-king was Sariputra] - A summary of this jataka with the title The lion-king willing to give his life for the monkeys’ appears in the King-liu yi-siang (T 2121, k 47, p 244b16-c9), a collection of texts taken from the Chinese Buddhist canon, compiled in 516 at Nankin by Pao-tch’ang A developed version of the same jataka also occurs in a new translation of the Sagaramatipariprccha, T 400, k 16, p 515a23-b19, made at the end of the 10th century The story is well known in central Asia The Khotanese Jatakastava (ed M J Dresden, 1955, no 32, p 436) dedicates a note to it: The vulture with sharp beak seized the young ones, two young monkeys whom the monkey had left in your charge for a refuge Your mind was most greatly agitated in your compassion - You tore the delicate skin on your limbs Great drops of blood, many and thick, a sacrifice, you gave away for them, as a propitiatory ransom, so that then he gave them back to you Representations on the painted walls: cf E Waldschmidt, Über die Darstellungen und den Stil des Wandgemälde aus Qyzil bei Kutcha I, in A von Le Coq, Buddhististische Spätantike in Mittelasien, VI, 1928, p 51, fig 154-157 1903them I have broken my promise and I invite you to make an agreement I am king of the animals (pasu) and you are king of the birds (paksin); our dignities being equal, an exchange can be made - The vulture answered: You do not appreciate the circumstances: today I am hungry and weary; why discuss our similarities and our differences? - Judging that it was impossible for him to gain satisfaction, with his own claws (tiksnanakha) the lion tore off the flesh of his sides (parsvamamsa) and traded it for the baby monkeys [The red fish]223 223 The mention of the yellow sickness and the red fish allows us to recognize the avadana of king Padmaka, told in many sources: 1) Avadanasataka, I, p 168-172, no 31: Padmaka (transl Feer, p 114-116) - Siuan tsi po yuan king, T 200, k 4, p 217a1-c4: no 31: King Lien-houa (Padmaka) gave up his body and became the red fish In olden times, the Bodhisattva was Padmaka, king of Benares An autumnal epidemic, the yellow sickness (panduroga), broke out in the city The king himself began to take care of his subjects, but all remedies were in vain The doctors advised him to capture the fish called Rohita to cure the sickness but no one succeeded in capturing it Faced with the distress of his subjects, the king sacrificed his life for them by wishing to appear as the great Rohita fish in the Valuka river of Benares He dropped on the terrace of his palace, immediately died and appeared in the river as the great fish like unto ambrosia (amrta) The inhabitants of the city ran up with their knives to cut up the still living fish For twelve years he filled beings with his own flesh and blood, never letting his mind stray from supreme bodhi When the disease died out, the Rohita fish raised his voice and said: I am king Padmaka; for you I have sacrificed my own life and have taken on this new form of existence When I attain supreme perfect bodhi, I will liberate you from the ultimate sickness (atyantavyadhi) - ie, samsara - and establish you in nirvana 2) Bodhisattvavadanakalpalata, 99th pllava: Padmakavdana, ed Dass, II, p 926-929, ed Vaidya, II, p 544: abhavam padmakamhyo ham varanasyam nrpah puru / sarvartiharanasaktah prajanam janakopamah // 4 // tenartipranidanena varayah sarito mbhasi / ksanenaivaham abhavam sumahan rohitas timih // 10 // 3) P’ou sa pen hing king, T 155, k 3, p 119b18-29: During an epidemic, the king Po-mi (Padmaka?) uprooted and burned the leaves of a tree that caused the sickness, then he threw himself into the water, changed into a fish and invited his subjects to eat him All the sick people who ate his flesh were cured 4) Khotanese Jatakastava, ed and transl by Dresden, p 439, 39th story: As King Padmaka, you saw the people in distress, ill with hunger, without refuge, troubled A red fish you became like a mountain of flesh The people ate you;

all those who ate his flesh were cured In this regard, T Watters, On Yuang Chwang’s Travels, I, p 236, mentions a Jataka of the Bodhisattva taking place in the land of Kuru, district of Thanesvar, capital Indraprastha According to the Ratnakuta, T 310, k 8, p 44c17- 29, when the Bodhisattva was Sakra devendra, he went to his country and changed into a reptile called called Jen- leang Rising up into the sky, he addressed the inhabitants of Jambudvipa in stanzas, promising to cure them if they cut off his flesh and ate it The sick people gathered there in crowds in the land of Kuru, cut up the reptile and ate it All were cured The flesh of the snake underwent no decrease and unendingly renewed itself 224 Unidentified Jataka 1905Once (bhutapurvam) the Bodhisattva was a bird (paksin) living in the forest He saw a man sunk in the deep water, a place not frequented by people The man [308a] had been caught in the net (jala) of the deity of the waters (udakadevata) Now whoever is taken by this net does not escape The bird knew the means to liberate him He went to the Perfumed Mountain (gandhamadana), took a medicinal plant (osadhi) and spread it over the net; the mesh of the net broke and the man was able to escape - There are innumerable stories of this kind where people are saved: they are called Jatakas X VAIPULYA P’i-fo-lie Vaipulya’ In the language of the Ts’in, it means developed sutra’ These are the Mahayanasutras, for example: Pan-jo-lo-mi king (Prajnaparamitasutra), Lieou-po-lo-li king (Satparamitasutra), Houa-cheou king (Kusalamulasamparigrahasutra), Fa-houa king (Saddharmapunḍarikasutra), Fo-pen-k’i-yin-yuan king, Yun king (Meghasutra), Ta-yun king (Mahameghasutra, perhaps T 387) <2301> - Innumerable and incalculable are the sutras of this kind preached for the obtaining of supreme perfect enlightenment (anuttara samyaksambodhi) XI ADBHUTADHARMA Wei-ts’eng-yeou Adbhutadharma’ When the Buddha manifests his many miraculous powers (rddhibala), beings are astonished at these miracles (adbhuta) Thus, at his birth,225 the Buddha emitted great rays (arcis) that illuminated the trisahasramhasahasralokadhatu and the dark intermediate places (lokantarika); he also illuminated the trisahasramahasahasralokadhatus of innumerable buddhas in the ten directions Then, in front of the Buddha’s mother there appeared a beautiful clear pool (udapana) to bathe the Bodhisattva Brahma-devaraja held a parasol (chattram dharayati), Sakra-devendra washed his body and two Nagas [each] emitted a stream of water (varidhara) As soon as he was born, the Bodhisattva took seven steps without anyone’s support (sampratajato bodhisattvah saptapadani prakrantah parigrhito na kenacit); wherever he placed his foot, lotuses grew up 225 The miracles that marked the birth of the Bodhisattva have been mentioned above, p 6-10F, 1343-1344F 1906(yatra yatra padam <2302> niksipati sma tatra tatra padmani pradurbhavanti sma) And he said: I will save all beings from birth (jati), old age (jara), sickness (vyadhi) and death (marana) There was a great trembling of the earth (prthivicala); the gods rained down flowers; the trees emitted sounds (ghosa) and heavenly music (divyaturya) began to play The innumerable marvels of this kind are called adbhutadharma XII UPADESA 1) The Louen-yi (upadesa) exegesis’ responds to questioners and explains the why’; furthermore, it broadly explains the meanings (artha) [Example of Sthaviran upadesa] Thus, the Buddha spoke of four truths (satya) Which are these truths? - The four noble truths (aryasatya) What are these four? - The noble truth of suffering (duhkha), its origin (samudaya), its cessation (nirodha) and the path that leads to it (nirodhagamini pratipad) That is an upadesa What is the noble truth of suffering? - The eight kinds of suffering: suffering of birth (jatiduhkha), etc226 What is the suffering of birth? In each place where a being is born, he experiences suffering - Exchanges such as these and answers broadly explaining the meaning are called Yeou-po-t’i- chö (upadesa) [Example of Mahayanist upadesa] Again, in the Mahayana, the Buddha spoke of the six perfections (paramita) What are these six perfections? They go from the perfection of generosity (danaparamita) up to the perfection of wisdom (prajnaparamita) What is the perfection of generosity? - The perfection of generosity is of two kinds: i) complete (sampanna); ii) incomplete (asampanna) What is complete perfection of generosity? - That which is joined to the perfection of wisdom and which is obtained by the <2303> bodhisattva who has reached the tenth abode (vihara) is said to be complete227 What is incomplete perfection of generosity? As long as the bodhisattva who, for the first time has produced the mind of bodhi (prathamacittotpadika), has not obtained the conviction that dharmas do not 226 Cf p 1458, n 1; 1745F; add Samghabheda, I, p 137 to the references 227 In the tenth ground, the bodhisattva attains anasrava prajna 1907arise (anutpattika dharmaksanti), his perfection of wisdom is not joined to the perfection of wisdom and is said to be incomplete228 [In regard to the following perfections], up to and including the perfection of dhyana, there are similar upadesas As for the perfection of wisdom (prajnaparamita), it is complete if it [308b] possesses the power of skillful means (upayabala); it is incomplete if it does not possess it229 2) Moreover, the following are also called upadesa: a the Commentaries given by the Buddha, b the sutras explained by Mahakatyayana,230 c the teachings given in accordance with the Dharma by worldly individuals (prthagjana) up to the period of the counterfeit Dharma (pratirupaka dharma) FINAL COMMENTS [The passage of the Prajnaparamitasutra commented on here spoke of the bodhisattva wishing to hear the twelve-membered speech of the Buddha,whether or not this speech has been heard by the sravakas (yac ca sravakaih srutam va na srutam va) Actually there is the speech of the Buddha not heard by the sravakas] <2304> Speech not heard by the sravakas: - 1) Sometimes, the Buddha preached the Dharna only to bodhisattvas and there were no sravakas there to hear 228 In the eighth ground, the bodhisattva obtains anutpattikadharmaksanti which destroys the passions (klesa) but does not completely eliminate their traces (vasana) 229 According to the Vimalakirtinirdesa, French transl, p 233, cited in the Bhavanakrama, I, p 194, wisdom (prajna) without skillful means (upayarahita) is bound (bandhana); furnished with skillful means (upayasamprayukta), it is free (moksa) 230 It happened that the Buddha, having briefly explained the Dharma, went back to his cell Then, doubting that they understood well, the monks went to Katyayana to ask him to explain the words of the Teacher, for, they thought: This Venerable Mahakatyayana, praised by the Teacher and venerated by his wise colleagues is able to explain fully the meaning (ayam kho ayasma Mahakaccano Satthu c’eva samvannito sambhavito ca vinnunam sabrahmacarinam, pahoti c’ayasma Mahakaccano imassa Bhagavata sankhittena uddesassa udditthassa vittharena attham avibhattassa vittharena attham vibhajitum): cf Majjhima,I, p 110; III, p 194, 223; Anguttara, V, p 256, 259-260 See also Vimalakirtidnirdesa, French transl, p 164-165 Elsewhere, the Buddha proclaimed Katyayana the foremost of those who explain fully the meaning of the concise words of the buddha’ (aggo sankhittena bhasitassa vittharena attham vibhajantanam): cf Anguttara, I, p 23 19082) Transforming himself by the power of his superknowledges (abhijnabala), the Buddha often went to universes accessible to one person only (ekayanalokadhatu)231 and preached the Dharma there 3) The Buddha preached the Dharma to the gods of the desire realm (kamadeva) and to the gods of the form realm (rupadeva),232 and as there are no sravakas there, the latter did not hear him Question - But there are arhats endowed with the six superknowledges (abhijna) and when the Buddha preaches, even if they are not there, they can hear him with the divine ear (divyasrotra) and see him with the divine eye (divyacaksus) If they really know things of the past by means of the memory of their earlier existences (purvanivasanasmrti), how then would they not have heard the Buddha? Answer - The power of the abhijnas of the sravakas does not extend that far: that is why they do not hear him [Ganḍavyuha]233 - Moreover, when the Buddha preached the Pou’k’o-sseu-<2305> yi-kiai-t’o king (Acintyavimoksasutra) to the great bodhisattvas, Sariputra and Maudgalyayana who were at the Buddha’s left and right, could not hear because they had not planted the causes and conditions necessary to hear Mahayana things Thus the ascetic in dhyana who has entered into the absorptions (samapatti) of the 231 Doubtful translation: see Edgerton, Hybrid Dictionary, p 154, sv ekayana 232 The Buddhas have access to the kamadhatu and rupadhatu heavens They go there by means of magic (rddhi) in the time it takes for a strong man to extend his bent arm or to bend his stretched arm (tadyatha balavan purusah samkuncitam va bahum prasarayet prasaritam va samkuncayet) During the seventh year of his public life, Sakyamuni went to spend the rains season in the Trayastrimsa heaven, one of the six classes of Kamadevas (cf p 2229F, n 2) The Buddha Sikhin, leaving the Arunavati palace, appeared (patur ahosi) in the Brahmaloka: Samyutta, I, p 155 The Buddha Sakyamuni, desiring to meet Baka brahma who was harboring heretical views, left the city of Ukkattha (in Kosala) where he was and came to the Brahmaloka: Majjhima, I, p 326 It is stated in the Samyutta, V, p 282, that the Buddha went to the Brahmaloka either in a spiritual body (manomayena kayena) or with a body formed out of the four great elements (catumahabhutikena kayena) 233 According to the Ganḍavyuha, also called Acintyavimoksa, the Buddha who was in the Jetavana in Sravasti together with an immense crowd of bodhisattvas and sravakas, entered into the simhavijrmbhitasamadhi and accomplished a whole series of wonders (vikurvita) Only the bodhisattvas saw it; the sravakas, Sariputra, Maudagalyayana, etc, who at the time were at the side of and behind the Blessed One, saw nothing Indeed, that which is in the range of sight of the bodhisattvas is not within the range of sight of the sravakas Ganḍavyuha, ed Suzuki, p 19: Te [sravakas] tatraiva Jetavane samnipatitah samnisanna Bhagavatah purato vamadaksinaprsthato Bhagavato bhimukham samnisanna na tani Jetavane buddhavikurvitany adraksuh // tat kasya hetor / abhijatabodhisattvacaksuspathavijneyam hi tam na sravakacaksuspathavijneyam / tena te mahasravakas tatraiva Jetavane sthitas tathagatavikurvitani buddhadhisthanani buddhaksetraparsuddhim bodhisattvasamnipattam na pasyanti // Chinese versions: T 278, k 44, p 679c; T 279, k 60, p 322b-323a; T 293, k 2, p 666a 1909spheres of totality (krtsnayatana) can cause all the waters (ap-) to change into fire (tejas),234 but other people cannot see this - [The Prajnaparamitasutra] also speaks about the bodhisattva] wishing to receive-retain (dharayitum) entirely the [speech of the Buddha] To receive’ is to be present respectfully; to retain’ is to remain for a long time without losing235 Tryadhvabuddhapravacana Third Section HEARING THE TEACHINGS OF THE BUDDHAS OF THE THREE TIMES Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 31, l 8-13; Satasahasrika, p 100, l 14-102, l 16) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes to understand, retain, practice and make known [widely] to others everything that the Blessed Buddhas in the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges have said, are saying, or will say (Punar aparam Sariputra yat kimcid dasasu diksu ganganadivalukopamesu lokadhatusu buddhair bhagavadbhir bhasitam bhasyate ca srutva tat sarvam udgrahitukamena dharayitukamena pratipattukamena parebhyas ca vistarena samprakasayitukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Question - Above (p 2276F), the Prajnaparamitasutra spoke of the [308c] bodhisattva who, in order to retain and not forget the words of the Buddhas of the ten directions, must practice the perfection of wisdom; why does it speak again here about understanding and retaining the teachings of the Buddhas of the three times? <2306> Answer - Above, the sutra spoke of the bodhisattva wishing to retain the teachings of the Buddhas of the ten directions and, since one does not know what the teachings were, it specified that it was a matter of the twelve-membered scripture (dvadasangapravacana) which the sravakas heard or did not hear Above, the sutra mentioned only the Buddhas in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges: here it speaks of the teachings of the Buddhas of the three times as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Above, it was a matter only of retaining, not forgetting, these teachings, and it was not a question of the benefits coming from this remembering; here the sutra wants them revealed to other people This is why the sutra has returned to this topic 234 This is explained fully in the Acintyavimoksasutra 235 This alinea is obviously a Chinese gloss 1910Fourth Section ASSURING ONE’S OWN GOOD AND THAT OF OTHERS Sutra - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes to understand what the Buddhas of the past have said and what the Buddhas of the future will say and, having understood it, to assure his own good and that of others (svaparartha) Sastra - Question - It is possible to understand (udgrahitum) and retain (dharayitum) the teachings currently given in the ten directions by the Buddhas of the present; but the teachings of the past have disappeared and those of the future do not yet exist; then how can one understand them? Answer - I have already answered that question above, but I must repeat myself here: The bodhisattva possesses a concentration called concentration of seeing the Buddhas of the three times’ (tryadhvabuddhadarsanansamadhi); the bodhisattva who has entered into this concentration sees all the Buddhas of the three times completely and hears their teaching (dharmadesana) Similarly also, some heretics (tirthika) and eminent hermits (purusarsi) see and hear, by the power of their wisdom (prajnabala), the things of the past (atitadhvan) that, however, have neither form (akrti) nor language (vyavahara) Furthermore, the power of the bodhisattvas is inconceivable (acintya) and, although the past has neither form nor language, they are able to see it and hear it <2307> either by using the power of the dharanis,236 or by inference (anumana), by deducing the things of the past and the future from the present This is why it is said here that, in order to obtain these results, it is necessary to practice the perfection of wisdom Andhakaravabhasana Fifth Section ILLUMINATING THE DARKNESS OF THE INTERMEDIARY WORLDS Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 31, l 15-19; Satasahasrika, p 102, l 16-104, l 16) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes to illumine with his brilliance all the darkness of the intermediary worlds - there where neither the sun nor the moon shines - in each of the ten directions, in the universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges (Punar aparam Sariputra ya dasasu diksu gangana-divalukopamesu lokadhatusv andhakaratamisra yatra 236 Particularly the srutadharadharani which has been mentioned above, p 318F, 328F, 1865F 1911suryacandrakasau na bhasatas tah sarva avabhasayitukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - When the Bodhisattva came down from the Tusita heaven into his mother’s womb (yasmin samaya bodhisattvas tusitad devanikayac cyutva matuh kuksav avakramati), his body emitted a radiance (avabhasa) that illuminated all the universes (lokadhatu) and also the intermediary worlds, the places of darkness (lokantarika andhakaratamisra) In the same way also, at the moment of his birth, his radiance shone everywhere In the same way also, he emitted a great radiance when he attained supreme perfect enlightenment (yasmin samaya nuttaram samyaksambodhim adhigacchati), when he turned the Wheel of Dharma (yasmin samaye dharmacakram pravartayati) and when he entered into parinirvana (yasmin samaya nupadisese nirvanadhatau parinirvasyate)237 In other circumstances as well, he manifests his great magical superknowledge (rddhyabhijna) and emits a great radiance Thus, when he wants to preach the Prajnaparamita, he manifests his great rddhyabhijna by means of a great brilliance that illumines everywhere the intermediary worlds, places <2308> of darkness (lokantarika andhakaratamisra) Thus is his miraculous radiance spoken of in many places in the sutras Question - But that is the power of the Buddha; why are you speaking [309a] about the bodhisattva here? Answer - Here it is matter of the bodhisattva wishing to obtain this power and to practice the perfection of wisdom for this purpose There are great bodhisattvas who have this power Thus the bodhisattva Pien- ki (Samantabhadra), the bodhisattvas Kouan-che-yin (Avalokitesvara), Tö-ta-che Mahasthamaprapta), Ming-kang (Jaliniprabha), Wou-leang-kouang (Amitabha), etc, have that power and their bodies emit an immense brilliance (paramanprabha) illuminating in the ten directions universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges [Great Sukhavativyuha] 238 - Thus, in the universe of the Buddha A-mi-t’o (Amita), the bodhisattvas emit a perpetual radiance (nityavabhasa) illuminating a hundred thousand leagues (yojanasatasahasra) Question - Because of what action (karman) does the bodhisattva acquire such a physical radiance? Answer - He has acquired this splendor thanks to the purity of his physical actions (kayakarmavisuddhi) 237 On these four occasions, the Buddha emits a brilliance that illumines all the universes and the intermediary worlds plunged into darkness The main source of inspiration for the Traite here is a sutta of the Anguttara, II, p 130-131, already mentioned above, p 1992F For these intermediary worlds, see p 1952F, n 2 238 Great Sukhavativyuha, ed A Ashikaga, p 49: Tasmin khalu punar Ananda buddhaksetre ye sravacaka te vyamaprabha, ye bodhisattvas te yojanakotisatasahasraprabhah; sthapayitva dvau bodhisattvau, yayoh prabhaya sa lokadhatuh satatasamitam nityavabhasasphuta - In this buddha field [of Sukhavati], the sravakas have a radiance of one armspan, the bodhisattvas have a radiance of hundreds of thousands of millions of leagues, except for the bodhisattvas [Avalokitesvara and Mahasthamaprapta] by whose light this [Sukhavati ] universe is constantly illuminated 1912[Pretasutra]239 - As is said in a sutra, there was a preta whose head was like that of a pig (suka) and foul- smelling insects (putikrmi) came out of his mouth; however, his body was golden in color (suvarnavarnavabhasa) In a previous lifetime (purvake janmani), this preta had been a bhiksu, but he insulted a stranger monk with harmful words (parusyavada) Since [as a bhiksu] he had observed the pure precepts (visuddhasila), his body had radiance; but, having uttered harmful words, stinking insects came out of his mouth A sutra says that, according to the purity of mind (cittavisuddhi), the radiance is superior (agra), middling (madhya) or inferior (avara) The Parittabhas, Apramanabhas, Abhasvaras [of the second dhyana] and the gods of the desire realm (kamadhatudeva) possess a radiance <2309> because, out of the purity of their mind, they make gifts and observe morality Moreover, some people, out of compassion for beings, have set lamps (dipa) in dark places; they have honored the holy images (pratima) and shrines (caitya); they have offered shining things like pearls (mani), windows, mirrors (adarsa), etc; this is why their bodies have radiance Moreover, by constantly practicing the mind of loving-kindness (maitricitta) and listening to all beings, the mind becomes pure [and the body shines] Moreover, by always practicing the concentration of the recollection of the Buddhas (buddhanusmrtisamadhi) and thinking about the high qualities of the Buddhas, one acquires a great bodily radiance Finally, the yogin who constantly practices the sphere of totality of fire (tejahkrtsnayatana) converts (paripacayati) fools (bala) and people of wrong view (mithyhadrsti) by means of the brilliance of his wisdom As a result of such actions, one acquires mentally the lucidity of wisdom (prajna) and brilliance physically As a result of such actions, one finds the purity of physical brilliance (kayavabhasavisuddhi) Sixth Section MAKING KNOWN THE NAMES OF THE THREE JEWELS (triratnasabdaprakasana) Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 31, l 19-32, l 1; Satasahasrika, p 104, l 16-106, l 20) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, in each of the ten directions, there are universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges where beings hear neither the name of Buddha nor the name of the Dharma nor the name of the Samgha The bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes to establish all these beings in right view and cause them to hear the names of the Three Jewels must practice the perfection of wisdom (Punar aparam Sariputra yavanto 239 Unidentified sutra 1913dasasu diksu ganganadivalukopama-lokadhatavo yatra na buddhasabdam na dharmasabdam na samghasabdam sattvah srnvanti, tatra lokadhatusu tan sarvasattvan samyadrstau pratisthapayitukamena triratnasabdan sravayitukamena bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - In a region where there had previously been no Buddha, no Dharma, no stupa, the bodhisattva builds a stupa and, as a result of this action, he obtains, in the course of a rebirth (punarbhava), the perfection of power (balasampad); in regions where there is no Buddha, no Dharma, no Samgha, he praises the Three Jewels (triratna) and helps beings enter into right view (samyagdrsti) <2310> It is said in a sutra: In a region where there is no buddha stupa, a man built a stupa and thus gained a brahmic merit (brahmam punyam), ie, an immense merit240 As a result of that, he quickly attains the dhyanas and, by means of these dhyanas, he acquires an immense superknowledge of magical power (rddhyabhijna) By its power, he goes in the ten directions and praises the Three Jewels and right view Those who previously did not know anything about the [309b] qualities (guna) of the Three Jewels acquire faith in them thanks to this bodhisattva By means of this faith (sraddha) in the Three Jewels, they are certain that sin (apatti) and merit (punya) have action (karman) as their cause and condition Thus, believing in the efficacy of actions, they understand that samsara is bondage (bandhana) and nirvana is liberation (moksa) For a eulogy on the Three Jewels, see (p 1340-1406F) what has been said in regard to the eight recollections (anusmrti) Seventh Section HEALING THE SICK AND THE UNFORTUNATE Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 32, l 4-8; Satasahasrika, p 106, l 20) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if [he formulates the following wish] in 240 The person who builds a Tathagata stupa where there has not previously been one is one of the four persons producing brahmic merit: cf Ekottara, T 125, k 21, p 656b1-9; Vibhasa, T 1545, k 82, p 425c13-21; Kosa, IV, p 250 Samghabheda, II, p, 206-207: - Catvara ime brahmam punyam prasavanti Katame catvarah (1) yah pudgalah apratisthitapurve prthivipradese tathagatasya  brahmam punyam prasavati, kalpam svargesu modate Transl - Four persons produce a brahmic merit: i) he who builds a stupa enclosing bodily relics of the Tathagata in a place on earth where there has not been one; ii) he who founds a monastery for the Community of monks of the four cardinal directions in a place on earth where there has not been one; iii) he who re-unites a community of disciples of the Tathagata where a schism had arisen; iv) he who embraces this entire world in a mind associated with loving-kindness, a mind free of enmity, free of rivalry, free of malice, developed, increased, immense, well-practiced, and remains therein These four persons produce a brahmic merit and rejoice in the heavens for a kalpa 1914regard to beings in the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges: By my power may the blind see, the deaf hear, madmen recover their minds, may naked people receive clothing and may those who are hungry and thirsty be satisfied (Punar aparam Sariputra ye dasasu diksu ganganadivalukpamesu lokadhatusv andhah sattvas te mamanubhavena caksusa rupani draksyanti, badhirah srotrena sabdan srosyanty, unmattah smrtim pratilapsyante, nagnas civarani pratilapsyante, ksudhitapipasitah purnapatra bhavisyantiti bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - The bodhisattvas who practice the unhindered (apratihata or anavarana) prajnaparamita become Buddha if they attain unhindered deliverance (vimoksa) But if they become bodhisattvas with a body born from the fundamental element (dharmadhatujakaya), like Manjusri, etc, dwelling on the tenth bhumi (viharabhumi), they are endowed with many perfections of qualities (gunasampad) Everyone who sees them obtains what they wish for (yathapranidhanam) Just as with the cintamani wishes are all fulfilled, so it is with the bodhisattvas of dharmadhatujakaya: everyone who sees them obtains what they desire Moreover, from his first production of the mind of bodhi (prathamacittotpada) and during innumerable kalpas, the Bodhisattva has healed the 96 eye diseases;241 for innumerable lifetimes, he has given his eyes to beings; by the brilliance of his wisdom (prajnavabhasa), he has destroyed the darkness of wrong views (mithyadrstitamas); out of his great compassion (mahakaruna), he wants the wishes of all beings to be fulfilled As a result of such actions, how would beings not recover their sight on seeing the body of the Bodhisattva? And it is the same for all the other sick people Concerning these [miraculous cures], see what has been said above (p 485-495F) in [the chapter XIV entitled] Fang-kouang (Rasmipramoksa) Manusyatmabhava Eight Section ASSURING A REBIRTH AMONG HUMANS Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 32, l 8-9; Satasasrika, p 109, l 20-110, l 4) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, in each of the ten directions, in <2312> universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, there are beings in the three bad destinies The bodhisattva-mahasattva who wishes that by his power, all those beings may attain a human existence must practice the perfection of wisdom (Punar aparam Sariputra ye dasasu diksu ganganadivalukopamesu lokadhatusu durgatyupapannah sattvas te sarve mamanubhavena manusyatmabhavam pratilapsyanta iti bodhisattvena mahasattvena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - 241 See above, p 486-487F 1915Question - It is as a result of a good action (kusaladharman) accomplished by oneself that one attains a human existence (manusyatmabhava) Why then does the bodhisattva here wish that, by his power (mamanubhavena), beings in the three bad destinies may find a human existence? Answer - It does not say that it is because of an action of the bodhisattva that beings obtain a human existence; it states only that it is as a result of the beneficent power (anubhava) of the bodhisattva that they obtain it By the power of his superknowledges (abhijna), his transformations (nirmana) and his preaching (dharmadesana), the bodhisattva makes beings practice the good (kusala) and thus acquire a human existence242 See what a sutra says: <2313> 242 Actions are strictly personal and non-communicable; the good as well as the bad actions ripen for their author and for no-one else: Majjhima, III, p 203: Kammassaka satta kammadayada kammayoni kammabandhu kammapatisarana - Beings have actions as their own property, heritage, womb, blood relations and refuge Majjhima, III, p 181: Tam kho pana te etam papam kammam n’eva matara katam na bhatara katam na bhaginiya katam na mittamaccehi katam na natisalohitehi katam na samanabrahmanehi katam na devatahi katam; taya v’ etam papam kammam katam; tvan neva tassa vipakam patisamvedissasi - This bad action which is yours was not done by your mother or your father or your brother or your sister or by your friends and advisers or your relatives and blood-kin or the monks and brahmanas or the gods You alone have done this bad action; you alone will gather the fruit of it Anguttara, III, p 186: Yam kammam karissati kalyanam va papakam va tassa dayado bhavissati - The man will be the inheritor of the good or bad actions that he will accomplish Action determines births: it projects beings into good or bad destinies: Majjhima, I, p 390: Yam karoti tena upapajjati - As the work that he accomplishes, such is the existence that falls due to him [Cf the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, IV, 4, 5 (ed Foucher, p 80): Yat karma kurute, tad abhisampadyate, he reaps according to his actions - Chandogya Upanisad, V, 10, 7 (ed Foucher, p 68): Tad ya iha ramaniyacaranah, abhyaso ha yat te ramaniyam yonim apadyeran Those who have satifactory conduct have the future of obtaining a satisfying birth] Majjhima, III, p 203: Kammam satte vibhajati yadidam hinappanitatataya - Action separates beings by distributing them among miserable or pleasant destinies Anguttara, III, p 415: Atthi kammam nirayavedaniyam, kammam tiracchanayonivedaniyam, atthi kammam pittivisayavedamiyam, atthi kammam manussalokavedaniyam, atthi kammam devalokavedaniyam, ayam vuccati kammanam vemattata - There are actions that ripen into feeling in the hell realm, among the animals, among the pretas, in the world of humans and finally in the world of the gods; such is the diversity of actions In the face of the rigidity of this doctrine, how is it that the bodhisattva can wish, in the sutra, that beings of the three bad destinies may obtain a human existence? Admittedly, it is not easy by carrying out himself an action the fruit of which will be gathered by others But nothing prevents the bodhisattva from using his power in such a way that the beings of the three bad destinies themselves carry out actions that will permit them to be reborn among humans Supposing even that the intervention of the bodhisattva turns out to be in vain, it will at least have the benefit of purifying his own mind The strict application of the law of karma does not prohibit the bodhisattva from formulating good wishes 1916[Mahavedallasutta, etc]243 - There are two conditions (pratyaya) required for the production of right view (samyagdrster utpadaya): i) externally (bahirdha), the hearing of the Holy Dharma (sadddharmasravana); ii) internally (adhyatmam), right reflecting (yoniso manasikara) As in the case of a plant (osadhi), internally there is a seed (bija); externally there is moist (sneha) earth and only subsequently, the plant is born (utpada)244 [309c] Without the bodhisattva, notwithstanding their [good actions], these beings would not be born [in a human existence] This is how we know how great is the good work carried out by the buddhas and bodhisattvas Question - But how does the bodhisattva make all the beings of the three bad destinies obtain deliverance (vimukti)? The Buddha himself would be unable to do so; how then could the bodhisattva? Answer - There is nothing wrong (dosa) in that the bodhisattva wishes to do that mentally Moreover, as many beings obtain deliverance, it is said here [hyperbolically] that all obtain it The body of the buddhas and great bodhisattvas emits immense rays everywhere (apramanan rasmin niscarayati); from these rays there appear innumerable emanation bodies (nirmanakaya) <2314> which penetrate the three bad destinies in the ten directions everywhere [ie, among the damned (naraka), the animals (tiryanc) and the pretas] Then, the fire is extinguished and the boiling water cools down in the hells (niraya); the beings who are there and whose minds are purified (cittavisuddhitvat) are reborn among the gods or among humans - The pretas, whose hunger and thirst (ksutpipasa) have been satisfied, develop a good mind and they too are reborn among the gods and humans - The animals (tiryagyoni), finding food wherever they wish (yatheccham), drive away their fears (bhaya), develop a good mind and they too are reborn among gods and men Thus all beings of the three bad destinies obtain deliverance (vimukti) Question - But other sutras245 say that these beings are reborn among the gods or humans (devamanusyesupapadyante); why does the Prajnaparamitasutra say here only that they obtain a human existence (manusyabhavam pratilabhante)? Answer - Among humans, it is possible to cultivate great qualities (mahaguna) and also find happiness (sukha) On the other hand, the gods are strongly attached to [heavenly] bliss and consequently cannot cultivate the Path (marga) This is why the bodhisattva wishes that the beings of the three bad destinies obtain a human birth only Finally, the bodhisattva does not wish that beings find happiness only; he also wants them to obtain deliverance (vimukti) and the eternal happiness of nirvana (nityasukhanirvana) This is why he does not mention rebirth among the gods here 243 Majjhima, I, p 294; Anguttara, I, p 87: Dve kho paccaya sammaditthiya uppadaya: parato ca ghoso yoniso ca manasikaro 244 A comparison developed in the Salistambasutra cited above, p 1152-1153F, note 245 Many sutras that say that at the dissolution of the body after death, beings endowed with good bodily, etc, actions are born in a good destiny [namely, those of gods and humans], in the heavens, in the worlds of the gods (kayasya bhedat param maranat sugatau svarge devalokesupa-padyante): cf Pali Concordance, I, p 248, sv ariyanam anupavadaka 1917 Ninth Section ESTABLISHING BEINGS IN THE FIVE PURE ELEMENTS Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 32, l 9-15; Satasahasrika, p 110, l 4-13) - The bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes, by the his own power, to establish (pratisthapita) beings in each of the ten directions in universes as many as the sands of the Ganges in morality (sila), concentration (samadhi), wisdom (prajna), deliverance (vimukti), knowledge <2315> and the vision of deliverance (vimuktijnanadarsana), and attain the fruit of srotaapanna and the others up to supreme complete enlightenment Sastra - Question - Above (p 2213F), the five pure elements (anasravaskandha) and the fruits of the Path (margaphala) were already discussed; why speak of them again? Answer - Above, it was a matter of the attributes only of the sravaka, the fruit of srotaapanna and the others up to nirvana without conditioned residue (nirupadhisesanirvana); here we are speaking of the three Vehicles all together: sravaka, pratyekabuddha [and Buddha] all attaining supreme complete enlightenment Tathagatateryapatha Tenth Section IMITATING THE BEARING OF THE BUDDHA Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 32, l 18; Satasahasrika, p 110, l 13-14) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhsattva-mahasattva who wishes to imitate the bearing of the Buddha must practice the perfection of wisdom (Punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvena mahasattvena tathatagateryapatham siksitukamena prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Question - What is the bearing (iryapatha) of the Buddha? Answer - The bearing is the four physical movements or postures: [walking (cankrama), standing (sthana), sitting (nisidana) and lying down (sayya)246] 246 According to the well-known stock phrase: Caturvidham iryapatham kalpayati cankramati tisthati nisidati sayyam kalpayati: Catusparisad, p 318; Divyavadana, p 161 1918 1 Walking (cankrama) Like the king of the elephants (nagaraja), the Buddha turns his body in order to look247 When he walks, his feet are four inches (caturangulam) above the ground and, although he does not set foot on the ground, the traces of the wheel on his soles are visible [on the earth]248 <2316> He walks neither too slowly nor too quickly249 He does not bend his body250 He always raises his right hand to reassure beings 2 Sitting posture (nisidana) He sits cross-legged with his body upright251 3 Lying down posture (sayya) [310a] He always lies down on his right side and places his knees one on top of the other252 247 Cf Majjhima, II, p 137: Avalokento kho pana so bhavam Gotamo sabbakayen’ eva avaloketi This is a polite gesture 248 Loke sutta of Anguttara, II, p 37-39; Samyukta, T 99, no 101, k 4, p 28a20-b18 and T 100, no 267, k 13, p 467a26-b24; Ekottara, T 125, k 31, p 717c18-718a12: In the land of Kosala, mid-way between Ukkattha and Setavya, the brahmana Dona saw footprints on the ground [read padesu in place of padesu: according to the Commentary of the Anguttara, III, p 77, pada is rather a place trodden by the feet (padehi akkanatatthana), a footprint (padavajaḷanja)] On these footprints there were thousand-rayed wheels with rims and all of the attributes (cakkani sahassarani sanabhikani sabbakaraparipurani) Dona told himself that these prints could not have been made by a man He followed them and finally saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree Struck by the dignity of the Teacher, he asked him if he were a deva, a gandharva, a yaksa or a man To all these questions the Lord answered in the negative and presented himself as Buddha It was then that he pronounced this famous phrase which the Lokottaravadins later blew up out of proportion: Seyyathapi uppalam evam eva kho loke jato loke samvaḍḍho lokam abhibhuyya viharami anupalitto lokena We may notice that the Chinese versions mentioned here reproduce this phrase only very incompletely On the footprints of the Buddha, see Hßbßgirin, II, p 187, sv Bussokuseki; Ceylon Encyclopedia, III, p 450, sv, Buddhapada 249 Majjhima, II, p 137: So natisigham gacchati natissanikam gacchati 250 Majjhima, II, p 137: So antaragharam pavisanto na kayam unnameti, na kayam onameti, na kayam sannameti, na kayam vinameti 251 Digha, I, p 71;

for him, good and bad food are the same254 <2317> 5 Manner of speaking (ghosa) To accept an invitation from people, he keeps silent and does not refuse255 His speech is gentle (manju), skillful, beneficial and timely256 As for the postures (iryapatha) of the dharmakaya Buddhas, they are: In one single stride (ekena padena), they traverse, in the east, universes as many as the sands of the Ganges, and the sermons (dharamdesana) of their brahmic voice (brahmasvara) has the same range For the characteristics of the dharmakaya Buddhas, see what has been said above (p 546F) Nagarajavalokita Eleventh Section LOOKING IN THE MANNER OF THE ELEPHANT, ETC Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 32, l 18-33, l 9; Satasahasarika, p 110, l 16-18;, p 110, l 20-111,l 1, and 111, l 18-112, l 7) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes this: May I look with the gaze of the king of the elephants The bodhisattva- mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes this: May I walk four inches above the ground without my feet touching the earth, and 252 Digha, II, p 134;

this is why, when one has something to look at, body and mind turn together Thus when a lion has seized its prey, it is not because the latter is small that the lion is going to cool its ardor258 It is the same for the Buddha When he has something to look at or something to say, his body and his mind function together (yugapad vartante) and never are separate Why? Because for incalculable periods (asamkhyeyakalpa), he has cultivated the faculty of attentiveness (ekacitta) and as a result of this action, the bone of his skull (murdhasti) is but one with the body:259 there is no separation between them Moreover, from lifetime to lifetime, the Buddha has eliminated pride (mana); this is why he does not scorn beings and when he looks at them, he turns completely towards them 257 For anatomical reasons as well as out of politeness, the Buddha, turning his whole body completely to the right, looks with the look of the elephant It is a time-honored expression: in Pali, nagapalokitam apaloketi (Digha, II, p 122, l 4; Majjhima, I, p 337, l 3); in Sanskrit, daksinena sarvakayena nagavalokitenavalokayati (Sanskrit Mahaparinirvana, p 226; a fragment of the Madhyamagama published by E Waldscmidt, Teufeleien in Turfan- Sanskrittexten, 1976, p 146, l 13-15) In Tibetan: gyas phyogs su sku tams cad phyogs te bal glan lta ba ltar gzigs The Chinese version of the Madhyamagama (T 26, k 30, p 622a12) renders nagavalokita as long-che dragon-naga’, whereas it is a matter of elephant-naga’ (hastinaga) The Commentary of the Majjhima, II, p 420-421 explains: Yatha nama hatthinago ito va etto va apaloketukamo givam aparivattetva sakalasariren’ eva nivattitva apaloketi, evam sakalasriren’ eva nivattitva apalokesi - Just as the elephant-naga wishing to look around, does not turn its neck but swivels its entire body in order to look, so the Buddha turns his whole body to look 258 The Buddha swivels his whole body as easily as an ordinary person turns his neck In the same way the lion is so powerful that it uses as much force to catch a small prey as a big one 259 The human body has 360 bones (asthi) according to the Astangasamgraha, 3, 5, and Astangahrdaya, 3, 3; 300 bones according to the Susruta, 3, 5 In Buddhas, they are fewer because many are fused together and the skull is joined to the trunk Above (p 278F, n 1) we have seen that the Vibhasa recognizes only 103 bones in buddhas 1921[Nithavadana]260 - As it is said in the Ni-t’o-a-pa-t’o-na (Nithavadana], Nitha was a street refuse-sweeper in the land of Sravasti and yet the Buddha patted his head with his hand and <2319> invited him to go forth from the world (pravrajitum); he was the only one who did not scorn him II LEVITATION The Buddha’s feet glide four inches above the ground If the Buddha were always flying, beings would suspect him of not being of the human race and would not take refuge (sarana) in him On the other hand, if the Buddha’s feet touched the ground, beings would find that he was no different from an ordinary being and would have no respect (gaurava) for him This is why, while gliding four inches above the ground, the Buddha does not trample the ground but yet the traces of the wheel appear on the ground Question - But the Buddha always emits a radiance one armspan in width (vyamaprabha),261 and his feet do not tread on the ground; why then would beings not honor him? Answer - For innumerable kalpas, beings have accumulated serious faults and so they have doubts about the Buddha They say: The Buddha is a master magician who deceives people with his tricks,262 or also: If his feet do not tread on the ground, it is because that is his nature (prakrtir asyasisa); what is so wonderful about a bird flying? There are beings who, as a result of the gravity of their faults, do not see the physical marks (laksana) of the Buddha and simply say: The Buddha is a very powerful sramana263 Those who speak in this way are like very sick people who, on the point of dying, consider the remedies (bhaisajya) and good food as stinking (durgandha) and consequently do not pay [310b] any attention to them III THE PROCESSION TO BODHI The Buddha goes to the foot of the bodhi tree surrounded and honored by many thousands of myriads of koti of devas, from <2320> the Caturmaharajakayikas to the Akanisthas: this is a constant rule (dharmata) among the Buddhas The Buddha Bhagavat goes to the foot of the bodhi tree in order to destroy two kinds of Maras, the fetter’ Mara (samyojanamara) and the lord-god Mara (isvaradevaputramara), and also to realize omniscience (sarvajnata) Why would the crowd of devas not honor him, not accompany him? 260 See p 1634F, n 1 261 This is the usual’ light of the Buddha; cf p 277F, 455F 262 Majjhima, I, p 375, 381; Anguttara, II, p 190, 193: Samano Gotamo mayavi, avattanim mayam janati annatithiyanam savake avatteti 263 In the canonical scriptures, the heretics address the Buddha by calling him Samano Gotama 1922Besides, from existence to existence, the devas have always helped and protected the Bodhisattva: already when he was leaving home, the devas made the palace people and the palace women sleep stupidly, and they held their hands over the hoofs of the horse [Kanthaka] when he leaped over the ramparts; now the devas make sure that they accompany the Bodhisattva to the foot of the bodhi tree Question - Why does the Prajnaparamitasutra not say that innumerable people (aprameyamanusya), ksatriyas, brahamanas, etc, accompany the Buddha, but speak only of the devas? Answer - The Buddha was alone in the deep forest when he began to look for the bodhi tree But the forest is not a place frequented by people This is why the sutra does not speak of people Moreover, men do not have the divine eye (divyacaksus) or the knowledge of another’s mind (paracittajnana) and consequently did not know that the Buddha was about to attain sambodhi This is why the sutra does not speak of men Moreover, the devas are higher than men This is why the sutra speaks only of devas Moreover, the Buddhas always love solitary places (viviktasthana),264 and as the devas hide themselves and do not show themselves, they do not disturb his solitude This is why the sutra speaks only of the presence of the devas Finally, seeing that the five bhiksus265 had gone away <2321> and abandoned him, the Bodhisattva went alone to the foot of the tree This is why he made the wish (pranidhana) [to be accompanied by the devas] Divyavastramstara Twelfth Section ATTAINING SAMBODHI ON A BED OF CELESTIAL ROBES Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 33, l 9-12; Satasahasrika, p 112, l 7-15) - The bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he envisages the following: At the time when I sit down at the foot of the bodhi tree, may the gods - from the Caturmaharajikas to the Akanisthas - lay down a bed of celestial robes there (Bodhisattvena mahasattvenaivam upapariksamanena kim iti me bodhidrumamule nisidatas caturmaharajakayika deva yavad akanistha deva divyavastrasamstaram kuryur’ iti prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) 264 The Blessed One was a solitary person and a lover of solitude: Bhagava pavibitto pavivekassa ca vannavadi (Majjhima, II, p 6, 8) Often he expressed the wish to retreat for a fortnight in solitude and no one was to approach him except to bring him food: Iccha’ aham bhikkahve aḍḍhamasam patisalliyitum namhi kenaci upasankamitabho annatra ekena pinḍapataniharakena (Samyutta, V, p 12, 320) All the Tathagatas had the same preference: Sunnagare kho tathagata abhiramanti (Vinaya, II, p 158) 265 The Five of the fortunate group, Ajnata-Kaunḍinya, etc, who had been present at the mortifications of the future Buddha and who had left him when he took some food: cf Majjhima, I, p 247 1923 Sastra - Question - But according to the sutras, the Buddha spead out grass (trna) at the foot of the tree and sitting on that, he attained sambodhi Why the does the bodhisattva wish for celestial garments (divyavastra) as a seat? Answer - It is in the sutras of the sravakas that it is a matter of a bunch of grass;266 the Mahayanasutras, on the other hand, refer to <2322> what beings saw: some saw him spread the grass at the foot of the tree, others saw him spread celestial mats; the visions vary according to the lesser or greater merits (punya) of the beings Moreover, the Buddhas of birth body (janmakayabuddha) collect grass at the foot of the tree, whereas the Buddhas of body born from the fundamental element (dharmadhatujakaya) use heavenly robes as seat or things higher than these robes Finally, the Buddha realizes sambodhi in a deep forest, at the foot of a tree; if there are people in the forest who see him, they offer him grass; if these are noble men (kulaja) who see him, they offer him garments of 266 Samghabheda, I, p 113 (T 1450, k 5, p 122c-23-28): Tato bodhisattvah kalikanagarajena samstuyamano vajrasanabhimukhah samprasthitah sa samlaksayati: trnasamstare nisadyam kalpayamiti tasya trnaih prayojanam iti sakro devanam indro bodhisattvasya cetasa cittam ajnaya gandhamadanat parvatat tulasamsparsanam turnanam bharam adaya svastikayavasikavarnam atmanam abhinirmaya bodhisattvasya prastad avasthitah bodhisattvah kathayati: bhadramukha diyantam mamaitani trnaniti sakrena devendrena bodhisattvasya padayor nipatya sagauravena dattani tato bodhisattvah svastikasyayavasikasyantikat trnany adaya devatopadistena margena yena bodhimulam tenopasankrantah; upasankramya anakulam asankulam trnasamstarakam prajnapayitum arabdhah Transl - Then the Bodhisattva, covered with praise by the naga king Kalika, went towards the Diamond Seat He said: I am going to sit on a bed of grass Seeing that he needed grass, Sakra king of the gods, taking to mind the Buddha’s thought, went to Mount Gandhamadana to gather an armful of grass, soft to the touch like cotton; he changed himself into a grass-seller called Svastika and went to stand in front of the Bodhisattva The Bodhisattva said to him: Friend, give me that grass Sakra king of the gods fell to the Bodhisattva’s feet and respectfully gave it to him Then, taking the grass that Svastika the grass-seller had given him, he went to the bodhi tree by way of the path the gods had shown him Having come there, he set about arranging the grass in an orderly way - The gift of grass by Svastika (in Pali, Sotthiya) is told in many sources: Mahisasaka Vin, T 1421, k 15, p 102c15-16; Dharmaguptaka Vin, T 1428,k 31, p 781a12-17 Lives of the Buddha: Sieou king pen k’i king, T 184, k 2, p 470a28-b2; P’ou yao king, T 186, k 5, p 514c13-20; Ta tchouang yen king, T 187, k 8, p 587a20-b4; Yin kouo king, T 189, k 3, p 639c4-11; Pen hing rsi king, T 190 k 26, p 773a7-20; Tchong hiu mo ho ti king, T 191, k 6, p 950a15-21; Pen hing king, T 193, k 3, p 75c25-28; Tch’ou yao king, T 212, k 7, p 644c11-14 Mahavastu, II, p 131, l 12; 264, l 5-7; Lalitavistara, P 286, l 3-288, l 10; Sad punḍarika, p 421, l 6-7 Nidanakatha, p 70-71 1924high quality as seat But in the forest there are no nobles; therefore it is a naga and the gods who each present to him a beautiful robe as a seat267 The robe of the Caturmaharajakayikas weighs two pala; that of the Trayastrimsa, one pala; that of the Yamas, eighteen dharana; that of the Tusitas, [310c] twelve dharana; that of the Nirmanaratis, six dharana; that of the Paranirmitavasavartins, three dharana The robe of the gods of the form realm (rupadhatu) has no weight The robe of the gods of the desire realm (kamadhatu), being made of tree-tips, has neither warp nor woof: it is like a thin skin of ice, clear with all sorts of colors, pure and of ineffable brilliance The Bodhisattva sits down on these precious robes spread out as as a seat and realizes supreme complete enlightenment (anuttara samyaksambodhi) Question - Why does the Prajnaparamitasutra speak only of the devas spreading out robes (vastra) and say nothing about the great bodhisattvas of the ten directions who themselves set out thrones (asana) for the Buddha?268 At the moment when the Buddha is going to realize sambodhi, all the bodhisattvas set out thrones for the Buddha < 2323> These thrones have a length of one league (yojana) and a width of one league, ten leagues, a hundred leagues, a thousand leagues, ten thousand leagues, an infinite number of leagues; and their height is also in proportion These precious thrones come from the pure merit (anasravapunya) of the bodhisattvas They are invisible to the divine eye and all the more so, they cannot be touched by the hand The Buddhas of the ten directions (dasadigbuddha) and the three times (tryadvabuddha), their victory over Mara (maradharsana), their enlightenment (abhisambodhana), their wonders (vyuha) and their Buddha deeds (buddhakarya) are seen clearly as though in a clear mirror (adarsa) Why then does the Prajnaparamitasutra not speak of these precious thrones? Answer - The Prajnaparamitas are of two kinds: i) those that are addressed both to the sravakas and to the bodhisattvas and devas; ii) those that concern bodhisattvas possessing the ten bhumis (dasaviharasamanvagata) exclusively It is in this latter type that the bodhisattvas setting out thrones for the Buddha’ will be discussed Why? The gratitude (krtajnana) which the devas have for the Buddha is not as great as that of the great bodhisattvas [separated from Buddhahood] by only one or two lifetimes Why would such bodhisattvas not be able to use the power of their superknowledges (abhijnabala) to honor the Buddha? But in the present passage, the Prajnaparamitasutra is addressed also to the sravakas; this is why it does not speak [of the great bodhisattvas, but only of the devas] Vajramayah pradesah Thirteenth Section CHANGING THE SURROUNDING GROUND INTO DIAMOND 267 See detail in chapter XX of the Lalitavistara, p 290-299: Bodhimanḍavyuha 268 Cf the gift of thrones related in the Vimalakirtinirdesa, French transl, p 247-250 1925Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 33, l 12-14; Satasahasrika, p 113, l 3-5) - The bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he envisages thus: When I shall have attained supreme complete enligtenment, may every place where I walk, stand, sit or lie down change into diamond (Bodhisattvena mahasattvenaivam upapariksamanena kim iti me nuttaram samyaksambodhim abhisambuddhasya gacchatas tisthato nisannasya sayanasya prthivipradeso varjramayah samtistheta’ iti prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - Question - Why is the earth (prthivi) changed into vajra diamond’ where the Buddha takes up the four postures (iryapatha)? <2324> 1926Answer269 - 1) According to some, when the Bodhisattva comes to the foot of the bodhi tree, he sits in this place and attains supreme complete enlightenment (anuttara samyaksambodhi) At that moment, the Bodhisattva penetrates the true nature of dharmas (dharmanam dharmata), and then there is no earth that can support him270 Why? For beings the earth is a deception and exists as retribution (vipaka) conditioned by previous actions (karman); this is why it is incapable of supporting <2325> the Bodhisattva When the Bodhisattva is about to realize sambodhi, he has knowledge of the true nature (dharmatajnana) as ’body’ (kaya), and then the place where he is seated changes into Vajra 269 The answer is inspired by the old Buddhist cosmology According to the canonical sutras (Digha, II, p 107; Kosavyakhya, p 15), the earth (prthivi) rests upon the water (udaka) or Circle of waters (abmanḍala); the water or Circle of waters rests on wind (vayu); the wind rests on space (akasa); space does not rest upon anything - In this summary, there is no mention of gold (kancana) or diamond (vajra) Later scholasticism, particularly that of the Sarvastivadins (Kosa, III, p 138-141; Kosabhasya, p 157-158) gives more details: 1) Resting on space, there arises below, by the force of the actions of beings, the Circle of wind (vayumanḍala): it is 1,600,000 leagues (yojana) high, immeasurable in circumference, solid (drḍha) to the extent of being unable to be cut into by Vajra thunderbolt, or diamond’ 2) Superimposed on the Circle of wind, the Circle of waters (abmanḍala), 1,120,000 yojanas high But after a certain time, stirred by the winds that create the power of actions, the water becomes gold (kancana) in its upper part, just as boiled milk becomes cream (pakvaksiri saribhavayogena) Then the Circle splits iinto two parts: a a lower part constituting the Circle of waters proper, 800,000 yojanas high, b an upper part, 320,000 yojanas high, called the earth of gold (kancanamayi mahi) in the Kosabhasya, p 158, l 13; the wheel of gold (kancanacakra) in the Sarvastivadin Agama cited in Siksasamuccaya, p 148, l 15; the Circle of gold and diamond (kancanavajramanḍala) in the Panjika, p 168, l 7 This last name, which associates vajra with gold, deserves to be remembered 3) Differing in height, the Circle of waters and the earth of gold are equal in diameter (1,203, 450 yojana) and in perimeter (3,610,350 yojana) 4) The earth of gold supports the earth (prthivi), the universe of four continents encircled by the cakravada which gives it the shape of a wheel Wherever the buddhas have attained or will attain sambodhi, the vajra which plunged into the waters, slips through the earth of gold (kancanamayi mahi) and comes to the surface of the earth where it forms the Diamond Seat (vajrasana) more than a hundred paces in circumference (Si-yu-ki, T 2087, k 8, p 915b15-17) For this Diamond Seat and the area of enlightenment (bodhimanḍa) that surrounds it, see Vimalakirtinirdesa, French transl, p 198-200, note; Ceylon Encyclopedia, III, p 207 and 217, sv Bodhimanḍa and Bodhipuja We may add that, in a figurative sense, the expression bodhimanḍa simply means the complete spiritual presence of the Dharma or Dharmakaya of the Buddhas 270 Cf Kosabhasya, p 161, l 12-14: Tasya [Jambudvipasya] madhye kancanamayyam prthivyam vajrasanam abhinirvrttam yasmin nisadya sarve bodhisattva vajropamam samadhim utpadayanti nahi tam anya asrayah pradeso va soḍhum samarthah - At the center of Jambudvipa, resting on the earth of gold, the Diamond Seat where all the bodhisattvas sit to realize the diamond-like concentration No other place, no other location is able to support the Bodhisattva [in this concentration] 19272) According to others, the Earth (prthivi) rests on the Circle of gold (kancanamaya manḍala or kancanamayi mahi); the Circle of gold rest on the Vajra; from the [upper] point of the Vajra arises a terrace (prasada) similar to a lotus flower (padmapuspa); just above, it supports the place where the Bodhisattva is sitting and prevents it from sinking This is why the area of enlightenment [311a] (bodhimanḍa) where the Bodhisattva sits is called Vajra 3) According to yet others, as soon as the Bodhisattva has realized sambodhi, every place where the Buddha takes up the four postures (iryapatha) changes into diamond Question - But the Vajra itself is deceptive for beings and exists as a result of actions: how can it support the Buddha? Answser - Even though the Vajra comes about by deception, it is much more solid (drḍha) than the Earth (prthivi) and nothing can surpass it The Vajra plunges into the water (ap-) and there the naga kings offer this solid substance to the Buddha and, as a result of the actions of his earlier lives (purvanivasakarman), the Buddha has this solid support (supratisthitasathana) Moreover, the Buddha transforms the Vajra and the four great elements (mahabhuta) into empty space (akasa), and this Akasa itself is not deceptive The wisdom (prajna) of the Buddha is not deceptive either [Akasa and Prajna) are both alike; this is why they can support him Ekakalata Fourteenth Section CARRYING OUT ABHISAMBODHI, PREACHING AND CONVERSIONS ALL IN THE SAME DAY Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 33, l 14-34, l 5; Satasahasrika, p 113, l 5-13) - Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva-mahasattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he envisages this: When I leave home and go forth, may I realize supreme complete enlightenment and turn the Wheel of Dharma on the same day, and When I turn the Wheel of Dharma, may innumerable incalculable beings obtain the purity of the dust-free and stainless eye of Dharma about dharmas; may innumerable and incalculable beings have their minds liberated from impurities by detachment from things; and may innumerable and incalculable beings become non-regressing in their course toward supreme complete enlightenment (Punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvena <2326> mahasattvenaivam upapariksamanena kim ity aham yatraiva divase bhiniskrameyam tatraiva divase nuttaram samyaksambodhim abhisambudhyeyam tatraiva divase dharmacakram pravartayeyam’ iti, kim iti me dharmacakram pravartayamanasyaprameyanam asamkhyeyanam sattvanam virajo vigatamalam dharmesu dharmacaksur visuddham, aprameyanam asamkhyeyanam sattvanam anupadayasravebhyas cittani vimucyeran, aprameya asamkhyeyah sattva avaivartika bhavyur anuttarayam samyaksambodhav’ iti prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - 1928I BECOMING BUDDHA AND PREACHING THE DHARMA THE SAME DAY In unfortunate ages (kalpakasaya),271 among beings of wrong views (mithyadrstika), in order to eliminate the wrong views of beings, some bodhisattvas devoted themselves zealously to very austere practices (duskaracarya) Thus, in the Uruvilva forest, the Buddha Sakyamuni ate only one grain of sesame (tila), one grain of rice (tanḍula)272 The heretics (tirthika) said: Even though he practiced austerities, our former teacher could not follow them for more than six years,273 and other men said: The Buddha is undergoing today the painful retribution (duhkhavipaka) of bad actions (akusalakarman) of his former lives274 There are some bodhisattvas who believe that the Buddha really suffered those pains; that is why they say to themselves: When I go forth, may I realize abhisambodhi on that same day Moerover, there are some bodhisattvas who go forth (abhiniskramanti) during fortunate times Thus Ta- t’ong-houei (Mahabhijnajnana), in search of abhisambodhi, sat cross-legged (paryankam abhujya) for ten lesser kalpas (antarakalpa) until <2327> he attained abhisambodhi275 Learning this, some bodhisattvas say to themselves: May I attain abhisambodhi on the same day that I go forth There are some bodhisattvas who, after having realized abhisambodhi, do not immediately turn the Wheel of Dharma (na sadyo dharmacakram pravartayanti) a Thus, for twelve years after he had attained abhisambodhi, the Buddha Jan-teng (Dipamkara) only emitted light rays (rasmi) and, as there was no one to understand him, did not preach the Dharma276 271 In his translation of the Lotus (T 262), Kumarajiva renders the expression kalpakasaya of the Sad punḍ, p 43, l 4; 65 l 13, by Ngo che The kalpakasaya is one of the five corruptions (Kosa, III, p 193) 272 On the fast and mortifications of Sakyamuni at Uruvilva, see p 12F, n 1 273 This was the thought of the Fortunate Five: cf Majjhima, I, p 247; Samghabheda, I, p 108, etc 274 The nine torments endured by the Buddha set a doctrinal problem which have been fully discussed above, p 507- 514F We may add to the references given in the note on p 509F the Mulasarv Vin, Gilgit Manuscripts, III, part I, p 211-218 According to the Hinayanists, by these torments and illnesses the Buddha expiated the wrong-doings of his former existences For the Mahayanists and the Traite (p 517F, 1512F), these were apparent faults and fictitious torments simulated by the Buddha for the benfit of others 275 Sa Punḍarika, p 160: Atha khalu bhiksavo dasanam antarakalpanam atyayena sa bhagavan Mahabhijnajnanabhibhus tathagato rhan samayaksambodho nuttaram samyaksambodhim abhisambuddhah Compare Gilgit recension, ed S Watanabe, p 76, and the Kashgar recension, ed H Toda, I, p 28 276 Vibhasa, T 1545, k 98, p 506a24 seq: The bodily brilliance (prabha) of the tathagata arhat samyaksambuddha Dipamkara shone and illumined the city of Dipavati Its perimeter was one yojana For twelve years there was no difference between day and night - Ibid, k 183, p 916b19-20: The buddha Dipamkara turned the wheel of Dharma in the city of Dipavati on Mount Ho-li-to-lo (?) It follows that, for the twelve years following his enlightenment, Dipamkara did his buddha-work by emitting an especially brilliant light Then, when he had found listeners capable of understanding, he turned the Wheel of Dharma during a first sermon 1929b Also, the Buddha Siu-chan-to (Susanta) who was about to become buddha but had no-one to receive his teachings, created a fictive buddha (nirmitabuddha) who, for a whole kalpa, preached the Dharma and saved beings, whereas Susanta himself had already entered parinirvana277 c Also, the Buddha Sakyamuni, having become buddha, waited 57 days before preaching the Dharma278 Learning this, some bodhisattvas say to themselves: May <2328> I turn [311b] the Wheel of Dharma immediately when I become buddha II SIMULTANEOUSLY PREACHING AND CONVERTING279 277 The Buddha Susanta has already been mentioned above (p 418F) The Pancavimḷsati speaks of him twice: T 223, k 21, p 374c26-29: Once there was a buddha called Susanta In order to save bodhisattvas, he created a buddha by emanation (nirmana), then himself entered into parinirvana For half a kalpa, this fictive buddha (nirmitabuddha) did the work of a buddha and, after having made the prediction (vyakarana), enterd into parinirvana All the beings in the world said that the Buddha was really parinirvanized, but, O Subhuti, fictive beings are really without birth or cessation T 223, k 23, p 390c4-6: The Buddha Susanta attained anuttara samyaksambodhi and, for the followers of the three Vehicles, he turned the Wheel of Dharma As there was nobody to receive the prediction (vyakarana) of Bodhisattva, Susanta created a buddha by emanation, abandoned his life and entered into nirvana without residue 278 See above, p 419F, n 1 279 To reach nirvana, the ascetic must travel a path of seeing (darsanamarga) which involves 16 moments of mind, and a path of meditation (bhavanamarga) which involves 162 moments of mind During this course, he enters into possession of four fruits of the path (margaphala), also called fruits of the religious life (sramanyaphala) He becomes srotaapanna at the 16th moment of the darsanamarga, sakrdagamin, anagamin and arhat (asaiksa) at, respectively, the 12th, 18th and 162nd moments of the bhavanamarga Buddhist texts use a stereotyped formula in describing the acquisition of the fruit of srotaapanna: In the venerable one there arises the eye of Dharma, without dust or stain, sometimes completed by the saying: He knows that all that has a beginning is subject to destruction Pali Concordance, II, p 408 sv dhammacakkhu, p 513, sv nirodhamma - Ayasmato N virajam vitamalam dammacakkhum udapadi yam kinci samudayadhammam sabbam tam nirodhadhamman ti Catusparisad, p 152;

Samghabheda, I, p 138, 139, 143; Nidanasamyukta, p 170; Mahavastu, III, p 227, l 4 - Ayusmato N anupadayasravebhyas cittam vimuktam (in plural, cittani vimuktani) Access to a fruit of the path is a type of conversion usually brought about by a speech of the Buddha Entry into possession of the fourth fruit, the fruit of arhat, is usually preceded by several sermons of the Buddha Thus Ajnata Kaunḍinya who, after Sakyamuni, was the second arhat in this world, attained the final goal after two times only: during the sermon on the four noble Truths, he became a srotaapanna, in possession of the dharmacaksus, but it was 1930 There are Buddhas who save beings, but in limited numbers Thus, when the Buddha Sakyamuni turned the Wheel of Dharma, <2329> Kiao-tch’en-jou (Kaunḍinya) was the only person to obtain the first [fruit] of the Path (prathamam margaphalam, ie, srotaapattiphala) and 80,000 devas also obtained the purity of the dust-free and stainless eye of Dharma (virajo vigatamalam dharmesu dharmacaksur visuddham)280 Learning that, some bodhisattvas [as here] make the following wish (pranidhana): When I turn the wheel of the Dharma, may innumerable incalculable beings obtain the purity of the dust-free stainless Dharma eye When the Buddha Sakyamuni first turned the Wheel of Dharma, a single bhiksu [namely Kaunḍinya] and some devas obtained the first [fruit of the path, the srotaapattiphala], but nobody obtained arhathood or the bodhi of the bodhisattvas This is why some bodhisattvas, [as here], make the following wish: When I become Buddha, may the minds of innumerable incalculable beings, by detachment in regard to things, have their minds liberated from the impurities, and may innumerable incalculable beings become irreversible in their course to supreme complete enlightenment Question - But in all the Buddhas, the magical power (rddhibala), qualities (guna) and salvific activity (sattvaparitrana) are the same;281 why then do these bodhisattvas make such wishes (pranidhana)? Answer - A single Buddha can create innumerable incalculable bodies by transformation (nirmana) and save beings by them However, in the universes (lokadhatu) some are pure (parisuddha) and some are only at the end of the sermon on non-self that his mind was liberated from impurities and he became arhat (cf Samghabheda, I, p 136, l 15-16, and p, 138, l6-7) The Samghabhedavastu of the Mulasarv Vinaya gives the list of the first 61 arhats and relates the historical detail of their final conversion 1) The Buddha Sakyamuni 2) Ajnata Kaunḍinya (I, p 138) 3-6) The other four members of the Fortunate Group (p 139) 7) Yasas (p 143) 8-11) The 50 young men of Benares (p 148) This list also appears in Catusparisad (p 162, 170, 180, 208, 212) and with slight differences, in the Pali Vinaya (I, p 14, 18, 19, 20) These conversions of limited number were never instantaneous and, to bring them to completion, the Buddha himself had to intervene several times with his encouragement and advice The bodhisattva pictured here by the Prajnaparamita wishes that, at his first sermon, innumerable beings would accede instantaneously to the fruits of the path A bold, not to say unrealizable wish, but quite to the honor of the bodhisattva 280 The Traite cites Sarvastivadin sources textually, the Catusparisad, p 152, and the Samghabheda, I, p 136: Asmin khalu dharmaparyaye bhasyamane ayusmata ajnatakaunḍinyasya virajo vigatamalam dharmesu dharmacaksur utpannam asitinam ca devatasahasranam - The Pali Vinaya (I, p 11, l 32-35) does not mention the gods, whereas the Mahavastu (III, p 333, l 19-334, l 1) mentions 18 koti of devas 281 On the similarities and differences among the Buddhas, see Kosa, VII, p 80-82, and notes 1931impure (aparisuddha) The bodhisattvas see or hear it said that some buddhas, by austerity (duskaracarya), have attained abhisambodhi with difficulty and have not immediately turned the Wheel of Dharma Thus, for example, <2340> the Buddha Sakyamuni realized abhisambodhi only after six years od austerity and, when he first turned the Wheel of Dharma, nobody obtained the bodhi of the arhats, still less the bodhi of the bodhisattvas282 This is why these bodhisattvas, not knowing that the buddhas are equal in power, make the wishes [mentioned here in the Prajnaparamitasutra] Nevertheless, the magical power (rddhibala) and the qualities (guna) are identical (sama) and without difference (nirvisista) in all the buddhas Ekadharmadesana Fifteenth Section BRINGING INNUMERABLE BEINGS TO ARHATHOOD BY A SINGLE SERMON Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 34, l 5-7; Satasahastika, p 113, l 13-16) - The bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he envisages thus: When I attain supreme complete enlightenment, may there be an immense incalculable saagha of sravakas, and may a single preaching of the Dharma be enough that, in one single session, [these innumerable incalculable sravakas] become arhats (Bodhisattvena mahasattvenaivam upapariksamanena kim iti me nuttaram samyaksambodhhim abhisambuddhasyaprameya samkheyah sravakasamgha bhaved ekadharmadesanaya caprameya asamkhyeyah sravaka ekasanika arhanto bhavyur’ iti prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - 1) There are Budhas whose sravakasamgha is limited Thus, the Buddha Sakyamuni had a samgha of 1250 bhiksus (ardhatrayodasani bhiksusatani)283 <2331> 282 Actually, as we have just seen, after the first sermon of the Buddha at Benares, Kaunḍinya and the gods obtained just the fruit of srotaapanna 283 At Uruvilva, Sakyamuni conferred ordination to a thousand Jatilas, disciples of the three Kasyapa brothers; soon after, he repeated the ordination at Rajagrha where he admitted into his order 250 disciples of the heretic Sanjaya, brought by Sariputra and Maudgalyayana In the company of these 1250 bhiksus, the Teacher traveled through Magadha, and this invasion of yellow robes outraged the population: The sramana Gautama, they said, is aiming at bringing about the absence of children, widowhood, the extinction of the family He has just ordained as monks the thousand Jatilas, then the two hundred and fifty parivrajakas of Sanjaya, and here many young people of good family in the country of Magadha are taking up the religious life under the direction of the sramana Gautama (Pali Vinaya, p 43; Catusparisad, p 394; Mahavastu, III, p 90) Many other ordinations were subsequently performed, but it remained understood that Sakyamuni’s samgha consisted of 1250 bhiksus: aḍḍhatelasa bhikkhusata (Vin I, p 220, l 20; 224, l 6; 249, l 13; Digha, I, p 47, l 4; 49, l 15; Samyutta, I, p 192, l 10) 1932The Buddha Maitreya will have a first assembly (samnipata) of 99 koti, a second assembly of 96 koti and a third assembly of 93 koti of listeners These buddha-samghas, each having their limit and their determined number, are dissimilar This is why some bodhisattvas wish, [as here],to have innumerable incalculable sravakas as samgha 2) There are Buddhas who preach the Dharma to beings [several times] At the time of the first sermon (dharmadesana), these beings obtain the first fruit of the Path (prathama margaphala), in the course of other sermons they obtain the second, third and fourth fruit of the path Thus when the Buddha Sakyamuni preached the Dharma to 500 bhiksus, the latter first obtained the first [fruit] of the Path and then, on another day, they [311c] obtained the bodhi of the arhats284 Sariputra first attained the first [fruit] of the Path, then after a fortnight (ardhamasa), he attained the bodhi of the arhats285 <2332> In their nidanas, the old sutras often mention the presence of 1250 bhiksus and perhaps this number is an index of the antiquity of these texts It may be noted that in the assembly where the Astasahasrika was preached there were 1250 bhiksus (ardhratrayodasani bhiksusatani), whereas those of the Pancavimsati and the Satasahasrika included 5000 (pancamatrani bhiksusahasrani) 284 The three brothers, hermits wearing braided hair and worshippers of fire (jatila), lived at Uruvilva: Uruvilva- Kasyapa, leader of 500 ascetics, Nadi-K, head of 300 ascetics, and Gaya-K head of 200 ascetics By a series of miracles, the Tathagata first converted Uruvilva-K and his 500 disciples They asked to be received into the order, which makes one think that they had acquired the dust-free stainless pure eye of Dharma and that they had acceded to the fruit of srotaapanna The Tathagata conferred on them (upasampad) and they became bhiksus (cf Vin I, p 33, l 12-13; CatuspariUsad, p 306) A little later, the 300 disciples of Nadi-K and the 200 disciples of Gaya-K also received ordination Accompanied by these 1000 Jatilas now bhiksus, the Tathagata went to Mount Gayasirsa, accomplished some miracles there and pronounced the famous Fire Sermon there: Sarvam adiptam Following this sermon, the minds of these thousand bhiksus was liberated from the impurities (tasya bhiksusahasranupadayasravebhyas cittam vimuktam) by detachment, which means, in other words, that they attained arhathood (Vin I, p 35, l 10-12; Catusparisad, p 322) 285 The Traite has devoted the entire chapter XVI, p 621-649F, to the story of Sariputra (= Upatisya) and Maudgalyayana (= Kolia), but here it is nvcessary to return to three events which made a mark in their lives: the attaining the fruit of srotaapanna (or if you wish, the conversion), the ordination and arriving at arhathood 1) The attainment of the fruit of srotaapanna - These two childhood friends set out on the search of the deathless, first started in the school of the sage Sanjaya (= Sanjayin) where there were 500 praivrajakas At Rajagrha, Sariputra met Asvajit, the Buddha’s first disciple and heard from his mouth the famous stanza summarizing the Buddha’s teaching in four lines: Ye dharma hetuprabhavah There immediately arose in him the dust-free stainless eye of the Dharma (Vin I, p 40, l 30-34; Catusparisad, p 378) Sariputra went on to communicate this stanza to his friend Maudgalayayana and the latter, in turn, entered into possession of this same fruit of the Path (Vin I, p 41, l 37-42, l 3; Catusparisad, p 384) 2) Ordination - The two friends decided to go to the Buddha who was then at the Venuvana in Rajagrha, and they were accompanied by 250 parivrajakas Upon their request, they received, at the Buddha’s call Ehibhiksuka, the 1933When Mahakasyapa saw the Buddha, he obtained the first [fruit] of the Path, then eight days later he became arhat286 <2334> minor ordination (pravrajya), the major ordination (upasampad) and the status of bhiksu (Vin I, p 43, l 6-7; Catusparisad, p 392; Mulasarv Vin, T 1444, k 2, p 1028a11-23) 3) Arrival at arhathood - Except for Sariputra and Maudgalyayana, all the parivrajakas 250 in number) acceded to the state of arhat (thapetva dve aggasavake avasesa arahattam papunimsu) at the very moment of their ordination Seven days after his ordination (pabbajitadivasato sattame divase), Maudgalyayana attained the summit of supreme knowledge of the sravakas (savakaparaminanassa matthakam patto), ie, he became arhat After a week of intense meditation, he had been seized by languor-torpor (thinamiddha), but the Buddha came to preach to him the Pacalasutta of the Anguttara (IV, p 85-91), and he shook off his sleepiness As for Sariputra, it was only after the fifteenth day following his ordination (pabbajitadivasato addhamasam atikkamitva) that he attained the summit of supreme knowledge of the sravakas He was then in the neighborhood of Rajagrha in the Sukarakhata cave and had heard Dirghanakha, his sister’s son, speaking with the Buddha, a dialogue recorded in the Vedanaparigghanasuttanta , better known as the Dighanakhasutta, Majjhima, I, p 497-501 [Cf the Dirghanakhavadana of the Avadanasataka where it is clearly specified (II, p 194, l 1) that Sariputra at that time was ardhamasopasampanna ordained for half a month’ All this is taken from the Commentary of the Dhammapada, 2nd edition, I, p 79-80; see also Mrs Rhys Davids, Psalms of the Brethren, p 341-342 Nidanakatha, p 85: Mahamoggallano sattahena arahattam papuni Sariputtathero addhamasena ubho pi ca ne Sattha aggasavakatthane thapesi Mahavastu, III, p 66-67: Sarvesam Sariputramaudgalayayanamukhanam bhiksusatanam anupadayasravebhyas cuttani vimuktani / ayusmams ca Mahamaudgalyayano saptahopasampanno rddhibalatam rddhivasitam ca anuprapune catvari ca pratisamvidani saksikare / ayusmam ca Sariputro ardhamasam pravrajito ardhamasopasampanno abhijnavasitam prajnaparamitam ca anuprapune catvari ca pratisamvidani saksikare / The fact that Sariputra and Maudgalyayana became arhat later than their companions was not at all because of weakness but, on the other hand, because of the vastness of their supreme sravaka knowledge (Dhp A, I, p 79, l 16: savakaparaminanassa mahantataya) In order for Sariputra to turn the Wheel of Dharma after the Buddha, an interval of a fortnight between his ordination and his accession to arhathood was necessary (see above, p 633F) 286 The main source is a passage of the Civrasutta of the Samyutta, II, p 219-221, but it must be complemented by other sources, placed in brackets here Disgusted by lay life, Mahakasyapa made himself an under-robe from pieces of cloth (patapilotokanam samghati) [Traite, p 1399F: This robe was worth a thousand pieces of gold Wanting to have a lowly beggar’s garment, he searched for rags but was unable to find any] Like the arhats in this world, he cut his hair and his beard, put on the yellow robe and went forth from home into homelessness Having gone forth, half-way he saw the Blessed One seated near the Bahuputta-Cetiya, between Rajagrha and Nalanda Having seen him, he wanted to bow to him [Kosavyakhya, p 374, l 11-15: But, they say, all the statues of the gods that Mahakasyapa bowed to broke into pieces due to his great power Approaching the Blessed One, he did not bow to him out of fear of destroying his body Knowing his intention, the Blessed One encouraged him, saying: Kasyapa, bow to the Tathagata Then he bowed down to him] 1934 Kasyapa prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One and said: The Blessed One is my teacher; I am his disciple (Sattha me Bhagava, savako ham asmi) [Kosabhasya, p 212, l 3 and 6: There are ten kinds of ordination (upasampad) ; the 4th, by recognizing the Blessed One as teacher, in the case of Mahakasyapa (dasavidha upasampad iti sastur abhyupagaman mahakasyapasya)] The Blessed One encouraged Kasyapa and, having encouraged him, he arose from his seat and went away Then Kasyapa said: For seven days while I was imperfect, I enjoyed the food [offered] by the land; on the eighth day, perfect knowledge was produced in me This comment confirms the assertion of the Traite in terms of which Kasyapa, when he saw the Buddha, obtained the first fruit of the Path, then, eight days later, became arhat Actually, by recognizing the Blessed One as teacher, he entered into the stream of nirvana’ (srotaapanna) and this recognition constituted his ordination Eight days later, perfect knowledge (ajna) was produced in him and he became arhat Kasyapa’s assertion which Bakkula will attribute to him (Majjhima, III, p 127, l 7-8) is worded in Pali as follows: Sattaham eva kho aham, avuso, sano ratthapinḍam bhunji, atha atthamiyam anna udapadi Enjoying the food of the land’ seems to be out of context, for the quest for food is the job of all monks, perfect as well as imperfect Sana, which I [Lamotte] have translated above as imperfect’ is a rare word According to the Commentary of the Samyutta, II, p 199, l 1, it means, etymologically, sa-ina, in debt’; in the figurative sense, sa- kilesa, with passions’ The commentary does not specify which ones, but as sana is opposed here to anna, the perfect knowledge of the saints, we could take it that it is all the passions to be abandoned by seeing the truths, or darsanaheyaklesa (cf Kosa, V, p 13) The sana would be something like a good worldly person (prthagjana) practicing the three siksa (high morality, high thought, high wisdom) in view of the destruction of the impurities (saiksa) The expression saiksa prthagjanakalyanaka is time-honored (Divya, p 419, l 17; 429, l 17) The Commentary of the Anguttara, I, p 183, l 8-10, has it that Kasyapa had been worldly (puthujjana) during the seven days that preceded his coming to arhathood (sattadivasamattam puthujjano hutva atuthame arune  arahattam papuni) Judging from the Chinese versions, the assertion made here by Kasyapa was formulated differently in the Sanskrit Samyukta: T 99, k 41, p 303c1-2: As for myself, for eight days, it was by practicing (siks-) the Dharma that I received alms-food; on the ninth day, I produced [the fruit] of asaiksa T 100, k 6, p 418c14-15: As for myself, for eight days, as saiksa, I obtained the [first] three fruits [: fruits of srotaapanna, sakrdagamin and anagamin], and on the ninth day, I destroyed all the impurities (asrava) and became arhat Compare Mahavastu, III, p 53, l 7-9: Sa khalv aham, ayusmann Ananda, bhagavata imina ovadena ovaditto asthaham evabhusi saikso sakaraniyo navame yevajnam aragaye - And as for myself, O venerable Ananda, encouraged by this exhortation of the Blessed One, for eight days I was yet a saiksa having still something to be done, and, on the ninth day exactly, I attained perfect knowledge] - Here, in abridged form, is the rest of the Civarasutta of the SaÛmutta, II, p 221 It is Kasyapa who is speaking: Then the Blessed One, going off the path, sat down at the foot of a tree Then I folded into four and spread out my samghati made of pieces of cloth, and I said to the Blessed One: May the Lord sit here; this will make me happy for a long time! 1935Ananda first obtaind the fruit of srotaapanna, then after having served the Buddha for twenty-five years and after the Buddha’s parinirvana, he became arhat287 Thus these arhats did not obtain the four [fruits] of the Path simultaneously This is why the bodhisattva [here] wishes that innumerable sravakas beome arhats in a single session (ekasanika) in the course of a single sermon of the Dharma <2335> Sixteenth Section LEADING INNUMERABLE BODHISATTVAS TO THE STATE OF AVAIVARTIKA BY MEANS OF A SINGLE SERMON Sutra (cfPancavimsati, p 34, l 4-5; Satasahasrika, p 113, l 16-17) - May I have an immense incalculable samgha of bodhisattva-mahasattvas and, in the course of a single sermon of the Dharma, may innumerable incalculable bodhisattvas become non-regressing (Kim iti me prameyo samkhyeyo bodhisattvanam mahasattvanam samgho bhaved ekadharmadesanaya caprameya asamkhyeya bodhisattva avaivartika bhaveyur’ iti) Sastra - The Blessed One sat down on the indicated seat and said to me: Your samghati made of pieces of cloth, O Kasyapa, is soft - May the lord accept my samghati out of pity for me! Will you wear, O Kasyapa, my worn out rags? - Yes, I will wear them, Lord Then I gave to the Blessed One my samghati made of pieces of cloth and I received in return the rags of hempen cloth, so worn-out, of the Blessed One 287 Anandasutta of the Samyutta, III, p 105-106 (Samyukta, T 99, k 10, p 66a5-b5): At the Jetavana in Sravasti, Ananda commented to his colleagues how useful (navaka) Purna Maitrayaniputra had been to them by teaching them that the notion of I am (asmiti) comes from the five aggregates and by making them see that the latter are impermanent Ananda ended his comment by saying: Idam ca pana me ayasmato punnassa Manataniputtassa dhammadesanam sutva dhammo abhisameto When I had understood this teaching of the Dharma by venerable Purna Maitrayaniputra, the Dharma was understood by me The long-winded speech of the Samyukta (l c) is more accurate and more complete: When I had heard this teaching, I obtained the perfectly pure dust-free and stainless eye of the Dharma (virajo vigatamalam dharmacaksur visuddham): since then, I have always preached this Dharma to the fourfold assembly, but I do not preach it to the anyatirthikas, sramanas, brahmanas and parivrajakas This then is the first fruit of the Path, the fruit of srotaapanna which Ananda obtained at that time: see also the Commentaries of the Samyutta, II, p 308, l 24-25 and the Theragathas in Psalms of the Brethren, p 349, etc - Ananda was the Buddhas attendant (upasthayaka) for the last twenty-five years of his life To the references noted above, p 94F, n1, and 1675F, n 1, add Samghabeda, II, p 59-64 - As we have seen above, p 100F, Ananda realized arhathood after the Buddha’s parinirvana, at the time of the Council of Rajagrha 1936This is what the bodhisattva wishes here 1) Most often the Buddhas have sravakas as samgha and do not have a special samgha of bodhisattvas, like Maitreya, Manjusri, etc Since the Buddha Sakyamuni did not have a special bodhisattva samgha, he entered into his sravaka samgha and sat there There are buddhas who, preaching the Dharma in reference to the single Vehicle (ekam yanam arabhya), choose for themselves an exclusively bodhisattva samgha Finally, there are buddhas who have a mixed (misra) samgha where sravakas and bodhisattvas are mingled Thus, in the buddhafield of Buddha Amita, the bodhisattva samgha is numerous and the sravaka sangha is fewer in number This is why the bodhisattva wishes [here] to have and immnse samgha of bodhisattvas 2) When certain buddhas first turn the Wheel of the Dharma, it happens that nobody becomes non- regressing’ [in the progress to supreme complete bodhi] This is why the bodhisattva [here] wishes that in the course of his first sermon of the Dharma, innumerable (aprameya) incalcukable (asamkhyeya) people become non-regressing Aparimitam ayuhpramanam Seventeenth Section OBTAINING THE IMMENSE LONGEVITY AND IMMENSE RADIANCE OF THE BUDDHAS Sutra (Pancavimsati, p 34, l 9-10; Satasahasrika, p 113, l 18-114, l 1) - The bodhisattva who wishes to obtain the limitless longevity and limitless radiance [of the Buddha] must practice the perfection of <2336> wisdom (Kim iti me parimitam cayuhpramanam bhaved ity aparimita ca prabhasampad bhaved iti prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - I APPARENT LONGEVITY OF THE BUDDHAS The length of life (ayuhpramana) of the Buddhas is long, or short:288 288 Compare the Sanskrit Mahavadana, ed Waldschmidt, p 69-70 and its Chinese versions, T 1, k 1, p 2a4-8; T 2, k 1, p 150b27-c5; T 4, p 159c11-15: Vipasyin 80,000; Sikhin 70,000; Visvabhuj 60,000; Krakasuna 40,000; Kanakamuni 30,000; Kasyapa 20,000; Sakyamuni 100 - Pali Mahapadana in Digha, II, p 3-4: Vipassi 80,000; Sikhi 70,000; Vessabhu 60,000; Konagamana 30,000; Kassapa 20,000; Gotama 100 See also above, p 269F, 299-300F 1937Pi-p’o-che (Vipasyin), 84,000 years Kiu-leou-souan-t’o (Krakasunda), 60,000 years Kia-na-k’ie-meou-ni (Kanakamuni), 30,000 years Kia-chö (Kasyapa), 20,000 years Che-kia-wen (Sakyamuni) a little more than 100 years Mi-lö (Maitreya), 84,000 years289 The ordinary radiance (prabha) of Buddha Sakyamuni is one armspan (vyama); that of Maitreya, ten lis290 II REAL LONGEVITY OF THE BUDDHAS The life-span (ayuhpramana) and radiance (prabha) of the buddhas are each of two kinds: i) hidden (tiraskrta), ii) apparent (aviskrta) [Those that are hidden] are real (bhuta); [those that are apparent] are manifested for the benefit of beings The real life-span is limitless (aparimita); the apparent life-span is limited amd measured for the benefit of beings The real life-span of the buddhas cannot be short (alpa) Why? Because the buddhas are endowed with causes and conditions that lead to a long life (dirghayuhsamvartaniya) [Bako brahma sutta]291 - Thus, for having once (purvanivase) saved the life of some villagers, P’o-k’ie-fan (Bakabrahma) obtained an immense (aprameya) incalculable (asamkhyeya) lifespan <2338> 289 Cf Madhyama, T 26, k 13, p 510b8;

Samyukta, T 99, no 1195, k 44, p 324b3-c16; T 100, no 108, k 6, p 412b7-c18; Sanskrit fragments in Mahakarmavibhanga, ed Levi, p 34, l 8-35, l 14 In Sanskrit the sutra is entitled Bakapratyekabrahmasutra The interlocutor of the Buddha is Bakabrahma, also called (in T 99) Bakabrahmadeva This sutra consists of two parts, one part in prose (which occurs in Majjhima, I, p 326) and one part in stanzas The following is a summary of the Pali recension: At that time the Blessed One was at Savatthi, in the Jeta forest in the garden of Anathapinḍika At that time, Bakabrahma conceived a wrong view He said: Our realm is permanent (nicca), solid (dhuva), eternal (sassata), definitive (kevala), not subject to disappearing (acavanadhamma) It is not born, it does not live, does not die, does not disappear and is not reborn; apart from it, there is no exit [from samsara] The Blessed One read his mind and in the time it takes for a strong man to extend his folded arm or to fold his extended arm, he disappeared from the Jetavana and appeared in the Brahmaloka 1938 Seeing the Blessed One coming from afar, Bakabrahma said to him: Come, O Lord, be welcome; it has taken a long time for you to come here The Blessed One said to Baka: You are wrong, O Baka; you are truly in error in claiming that your realm is permanent, etc Baka - We are seventy-two, O Gotama, who have accomplished meritorious actions We are sovereign beings (vasavattin) who have gone beyond birth and death Our ultimate rebirth as Brahma comes from the Vedas Many are the people who invoke us The Blessed One - Brief and not long is your life that you consider to be long I myself know, O Brahma, that your life-span will be a hundred thousand nirabhuda Baka - Blessed One, if you are the Seer of eternity who has triumphed over birth, old age and sorrow, tell me what have been my previous vows and my good practices, which I know - Four jatakas describing the ups and downs of Baka during his earlier lives explain why, without being eternal, he now enjoys a long life The jataka to which the Traite alludes here is first in the Chinese versions of the Samyukta, but second in the Pali Samyutta: 1) Samyutta, I, p 143, l 24-27: Yam enikulasmim janam gahitam / amocayi gayhakam niyyamanam // tan-te puranam vatasilavattam / suttappabuddho va anusarami // On the banks of the Eni (= the Ganges), you freed a crowd who had been seized, captured and led away This vow and this good action that once were yours, I remember them like someone who wakes up from a dream 2) Mahakarmavibhanga, p 34, l 14-35, l 6: Ya enikule janatam grhitam Eni nama nadi / yasya anukule raja kascid grhitah pratamitrena Himavantam anupravisya / sa niyamana eva vadhyam praptah sabalavahanah / tena rsibhutena rddhya vatavarsam muktam / sa copayena pratyamitrajanakayo vibhramitah sa raja moksitah / tat te dvitiyam vratasilavrttam / svapnad vibuddho nusmarami // sa ca raja Bodhisattvo babhuva // On the banks of the Eni the prisoner crowd  The Eni is a river On its banks, a certain king was seized by his enemy who took him away to the Himavat This king taken by force with his army and his chariots wa abojut to be put to death [Baka] who was then a hermit magically unleashed the wind and the rain By this trick, the enemy armies were dispersed and the king was saved This king was none other than the future Buddha [in an earlier existence] 3) Samyukta, T 99, k 44, p 324c1-4 Once the inhabitants of a village (gramaka) were captured and robbed by thieves (caura); but then you saved them all and they found freedom On your part, this was a vow and a good action (vratasilavrtta) As for myself, I remember this story (nidana) as if I had come out of a dream (suptaprabuddha iva) 4) Samyukta, T 100, k 6, p 412c1-4: 1939In the world of the Brahma gods (brahmaloka), the life-span does not surpass a half kalpa;292 and this brahmadeva [Baka] is alone in having an immense longevity Thus he conceived a wrong view <2339> (mithyadrsti) and said: I alone am eternally subsistent (nityastha) The Buddha went to him and, to destroy this wrong view, told him a jataka [from which it emerges] that Bakabrahma is enjoying such a long life for having formerly saved a village All the more reason that the life of the Buddha should be long, the Buddha who, from lifetime to lifetime, has saved innumerable incalculable beings, either by helping them with material goods (amisadravya) or by exchanging his life for theirs Then why should not his lifespan surpass one hundred years? Furthermore, the discipline of abstaining from taking life (pranatipataprativirati) is the karmic cause and condition leading to a long life (dirghayuhsamvartaniya) In his great loving-kindness (mahamaitri), the Buddha has an affection (preman) for beings which penetrates to the marrow of the bones (asthimajjan) He is constantly dying for beings: why then would he destroy life? Answer - Jambudvipa being bad, the life of the Buddha there must be short In other places that are good, the life of the Buddha would be long Question - If that is so, the Bodhisattva who is born in the palace <2340> of king Suddhodana in this Jambudvipa, who leaves home (abhiniskramati) and who realizes enlightenment (abhisambudhyate) is the Once there were thieves (caura) who looted and damaged a village (grama), oppressed and tied up the inhabitants and escaped with great spoils At the time, you manifested great bravery, saved all the people and as a result, they suffered no damage It is to this jataka that the Traite is alluding here It is told in full in the Commentary of the Samyutta, I, p 210-211, of which here is the translation: Another time, the penitent [Baka] built himself a hut of leaves at the edge of the Ganges near a forest village Brigands descended on this village one day and went away carrying with them the furniture, the livestock and the slaves The oxen, the dogs and the people uttered great shouts The penitent heard them; he wondered what it was, understood that a danger menaced the people and declared that, if he were alive, these beings would not perish He entered into dhyana based upon the superknowledges, then, emerging from it, he created an army facing the brigands by means of a mind of abhijna Blue with fear, the brigands thought that the king was certainly coming to attack them and, putting down their spoils, they took flight The penitent ordered each person to take back his own property and that was so - Before taking rebirth in the Brahmaloka, Baka was a Buddhist monastic It is said in the Tsa pao tsang king, T 203, k 3, p 461a13-15: There was an ayusmat camed P’o-k’ie (Baka) Venerable Sariputra and Maudgalyayana taught him the contents of the Dharma (dharmoddana) and he became anagamin After death, he was reborn among the Brahmadevas and had the name P’o-k’ie-fan (Bakabrahma) When Kokalika, a disciple of Devadatta, accused Sariputra and Maudgalyayana of misconduct, Bakabrahma came down from the Brahma heaven to defend his former teachers (see above, p 807-809F) 292 The Brahma gods occupying the first dhyana include three categories: the Brahmakayikas, the Brahmapurohitas and the Mahabrahmas For their size and their lifespan, see Hßbßgirin, p 115a sv Bon For the reasons just explained, Bakabrahma was assured of an exceptionally long lifespan, but not eternal 1940real Buddha; and in other places, by his magical power (rddhibala), he creates by emanation (nirmite) fictive buddhas who save beings Answer - That is not correct Why? Because, in the Jambudvipa of the other universes, each one says to himself: The Buddha here is the real Buddha; the Buddhas elsewhere are the fictive (nirmite) Buddhas How do we know that? In the Jambudvipas of the other universes, if they know that the Buddha is fictive, they would not accept his teachings (sasana) or his rules (siksapada) with faith Let us take a strange universe where the human life-span (ayuhpramana) is a kalpa; for these people, a buddha of one hundred years would not even have lived for a single one of their days; the people would merely scorn him (avamana) and would not accept his teaching The Buddha transforms the kalpa which these beings hold as real as he pleases [Suramgamasamadhisutra]293 - This is what is said in the Cheou-leng-yen-king (Suramgamasutra): The life of the Buddha Chen-t’ong-pien-tchao (Vikurvanavairocana) is 700,000 incalculable periods (asamkhyeyakalpa) The Buddha [Sakyamuni] said to Manjusri: That buddha is myself, and the Buddha [Vairocana] in turn said: The Buddha Sakyamuni is myself From that we know that the life-span (ayuhpramana) of the buddhas is [312b] truly limitless (aparimita) In order to save beings, the Buddhas manifest a long life (dirgha) or a short life (alpa) [according to the circumstances] As you said above (p 2339F), the Buddha Sakyamuni who saves beings by his magical power (rddhibala) does not have an [apparent] life-span different from that of people; there is no need for him to live for a hundred years: in one single day he could perform his buddha activity (buddhakarya) [Miracle of the multiplication of fictive Buddhas]294 - Thus, one day Ananda had the following thought: The bhagavat Jan-teng (Dipamkara), the buddha Yi-ts’ie-cheng (Visvabhu) and the buddha Pi-p’o-che (Vipasyin) appeared during favorable ages; their life-spans (ayuhpramana) were very long and they were able to fullfil their buddha activity (buddhakarya) My Buddha Sakyamuni has appeared in a bad age (kalpakasaya) and his life-span will be very short Soon there will be no more Bhagavat and he will not be able to complete fully (paripr-) his buddha activity At that very moment, the Bhagavat entered into the concentration of the rising sun (suryadayasamadhi) and created innumerable buddhas, as many as the rays (rasmi) of the sun spreading in the ten directions, by emanation (nirmana) from his body Each of these fictive buddhas (nirmitabuddha) was in the universes and each one there fulfilled his buddha activity: some preached the Dharma, others manifested the superknowledges (abhijna), others were in samadhi, others took their meals: in these many ways, they did the work of the Buddha and saved beings On emerging from this concentration, the Buddha asked Ananda: Did you see and hear all these things? - Ananda answerd: Yes, I saw them 293 Cf Suramgamasamadhi, French transl, p 267-270 294 See p 531-535F, 1352-1353F The Traite returns here for the third time to this sutra which I [Lamotte] have not been able to identify exactly 1941The Buddha asked Ananda: Does the Buddha fulfill his buddha activity by such magical power (rddhibala)? - Ananda replied: Supposing that the Buddha lived only a single day, even the plants (trnakastha) of the great earth would all be saved, and beings also; all the more reason when he lives for a hundred years From that we know that the life-span of the buddhas is limitless (aparimita) but that, in order to save beings, they manifest either a long life or a short life Thus, when the rising sun is reflected (pratibhasate) in a body of water, it is regulated (anuvartate) by the size of the body of water; if it is large, the reflection lasts for a long time; if it is small, the reflection quickly disappears When the sun lights up a mountainof lapis-lazuli (vaiḍurya), crystal (sphatika) or pearl (mani), its reflection (pratibimba) lasts for a long time When fire burns plants, if the latter are not numerous, it is quickly extinguished but if they are numerous, it lasts for a long time On the pretext that there is no more fire in the place where it is extinguished, we cannot say that there were places where it burns for a long time The interpretation is the same in regard to the dimensions of the Buddha’s radiance (buddhaprabha) 1942CHAPTER LII: ELIMINATION OF THE TRIPLE POISON First Section ELIMINATING THE THREE POISONS Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 34, l 10-15; Satasahasrika,p114, l 3-10) - The bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he envisages the following: When I have attained supreme complete enlightenment, may there be no desire, no hatred, no delusion in my buddha-field and may even the name of the triple poison be absent and, From then on, may all beings be endowed with wisdom so that they recognize: Good is generosity! Good is discipline! Good is self-mastery! Good is continence! Good is non-violence toward living beings!

Answer - Desire (raga), hatred (dvesa) and delusion (moha) are called the three roots of evil (akusalamula):295 these are the dharmas that have the realm of desire (kamadhatvavacara) as their domain When the Buddha speaks of desire, hatred and delusion, it is a question of [the roots of evil] belonging to the desire realm, but when <2344> he speaks of afflicted ignorance (klistavidya), the latter penetrates all three realms296 There are buddha-fields that contain only (kevalam) men of desire: for these beings the bodhisattva [here] wishes that, at the time when he becomes Buddha, in his universe there will be neither the three poisons (trivisa) nor even the name of the three poisons (trivisasabda) But there are also pure buddha-fields (parisuddhabuddhaksetra) that contain only non-regressing bodhisattvas (avaivartika) with body born from 295 Digha, III, p 214; Anguttara, I, p 201: Tini akusalamulani Lobho akusalamulam, doso akusalamulam, moho akusalamulam 296 Afflicted ignorance (klistavidya) is present in the triple world: it is not moha, the root of evil but, more precisely, sammoha, confusion, in regard to the truths: cf Kosa, V, p 71 1943the fundamental element (dharmadhatujakaya); they no longer have any passions (klesa) but retain only the traces (vasana);297 for them the bodhisattva wishes that even the name of the triple poison will be absent in his universe Some say: When the bodhisattva formulates the vow to save all beings, beings are really not all saved Similarly here, when he wishes that in his universe there would not be the name of the three poisons, it is clear that the three poisons will still be found there and will not be exhausted Indeed, if there were no more triple poison, of what use would the Buddhas still be? If on earth there were no more great shadows (tamas) we would not need the light of the sun As it is said in a sutra: [Abhavyasutra]298 - If three dharmas did not exist, the Buddha <2345> would not be born into the world, and if these three dharmas are not destroyed, it would be impossible (abhavya) to escape old age, sickness and death These three dharmas are the three poisons Finally, there are universes (lokadhatu) where beings, analyzing dharmas, say: This is good (kusala), that is not good (akusala); this is bondage (bandhana), that is deliverance (moksa), etc;299 and they indulge in futile chatter (prapanca) about nirvana of unique nature (ekalaksana-nirvana) This is why the bodhisattva 297 As we have seen above, p 1760F seq, the traces of the passions (klesavasana) persist in the arhat and even in the avaivartika bodhisattvas of the eighth bhumi; only the Buddha has eliminated them 298 Abhavyasutra of the Nidanasamyukta, p 204-210 (Chinese versions, T 99, no 346, k 14, p 95c17-06b24; T 99, no760, k 28, p 199c27-200a13) and Abhabbo sutta of Anguttara, V, p 144-149 - Comparative study in E Waldschmidt, Identifizierung einer Handscrift des Nidanasamyukta aus den Turfan-Funden, ZDMG, 107 (1957), p 372-401; Sutra of the Nidanasamyukta, BSOAS, XX (1957), p 569-579 Sanskrit: magadhesu nid anam / traya ime bhiksavo dharma samvidyante anista amanapa lokasya / katame trayah / tadyatha vyadhir  abhavyo vyadhim jaram maranam prahatum / Pali: tayo bjhikkhave dhamma loke na samvijjeyyum na thatagato loke  appahaya abhabbo jatim pahatum jaram pahatum maranam pahatum / Transl of the Sanskrit - The story took place in Magadha There are, O monks, three unpleasant, disagreeable and annoying things for the world What are these three things? They are sickness, old age and death If these three things, unpleasant, disagreeable and annoying to the world, did not exist, the Tathagatas, saints, fully and rightly enlightened, would not be born in the world to throw light on the well-preached doctrine and discipline But since the three things, unpleasant, disagreeable and annoying to the world, namely old age, sickness and death, do exist, the Tathagatas, saints, rightly and fully enlightened, are born into the world to bring to light the well-preached doctrine and discipline If one has not rejected three [other] things, one is incapable of avoiding sickness, old age and death What are these three things? They are desire, hatred and delusion If one has not rejected these three things, one is incapable of avoiding sickness, old age and death - The Traite has twice already referred to this sutra: cf p 300F, n 2; p 543F, n 1 299 On these dualistic conceptions formally condemned by the Madhyamaka, see chap VIII of the Vimalakirtinirdesa, French transl, p 301-318; the distinction between bandhana and moksa is criticized, p 306 at top of page 1944hopes [here] that, in his universe, beings do not produce the three poisons, knowing full well that the true nature of the three poisons (trivisadharmata) is nirvana300 <2346> II ENDOWING THE KSETRA WITH A SPECIAL WISDOM Question - [The bodhisattva hopes here that in his buddhaksetra] all beings are endowed with such a wisdom that What is this wisdom (prajna)? Answer - This wisdom is the correct worldly view (laukiki samyagdrsti) In this correct worldly view, beings say: There is generosity (asti danam), there is [fruit of ripening] of good or bad actions (asti sukrtaduskrtanam karmanam vipakaphalam), there is a world here below and a world beyond (asty ayam loko sti paro lokah), there are arhats301 Believing in the existence of good and bad actions, <2347>, they approve of generosity (dana); believing in the existence of arhats, they approve of morality (sila), they approve of concentration (samadhi), they approve of continence (brahmacarya) Having obtained the 300 The three poisons, raga, dvesa and moha are no longer to be rejected but rather to be taken, for they are themselves deliverances: Vimalakirtinirdesa, French transl, p 156, 264, 274, 286, 289, 310 301 The distinction between mundane (laukiki) and supramundane (lokottara) samyagdrsrti is canonical Here the Traite reproduces almost literally the Cattarisakasutta of the Majjhima, III, p 72, l 4-20 (compare Samyukta, T 99, no 28, p 203a21-b2) Sammaditthim p’ aham, bhikkhave, dvayam vadami Atthi, bhikkhave, sammaditthi sasava punnabhagiya upadhivepakka; atthi, bhikkhave, sammaditthi ariya  pannindriyam pannabalam dhammavicayasambojjhango sammaditthi magganga Transl - I say, O monks, there are two kinds of right view There is an impure right view contributing to merit and ending up in a rebirth; there is a noble supramundane pure right view, constituting a member of the Path What is the impure right view, contributing to merit and leading to a rebirth? There is generosity, there is sacrifice, there is oblation, there is fruit of ripening of good or bad actions, there is a world down here and a world beyond, there are in the world monks and brahamanas of right progress and right conduct who, having realized this world and the other world by their own superknowledge, teach them, What is the noble pure supramundane right view, constituting a member of the path? In a man of noble mind, of pure mind who is in possession of the noble Path and cultivates the noble Path, it is the wisdom, the faculty of wisdom, the power of wisdom, the factor of enlightenment called discrimination of dharmas, the right view constituting a factor of the path - In contrast to the heathen (mithyadrstika), the man with mundane right view respects the natural (or conventional law); he believes in the efficacy of rituals, in reward for good and punishment for evil, in the future life; he honors his parents and the deities; he venerates monks and brahamanas But this right mundane view is impure (sasrava) because it rests on the belief in the self, in the atman, which is a false belief Although it contributes to gaining merit (punyabhagiya) and leads to good rebirths in the higher destinies, it is incapable of putting an end to suffering and does not assure deliverance On the other hand, the right supramundane view, not contaminated by belief in the self and which is a factor of the Path, is truly liberating 1945power of right view (samyagdrsti), they approve of non-violence toward beings (avihimsa sarvapranibhutesu) This mundane correct view (laukiki samyagdrsti) is the root (mula) of wisdom free of impurities (anasrava prajna) This is why the bodhisattva wishes here that the name of the three poisons is not found in his field Desire (raga) is of two kinds: bad desire (mithyaraga) and simple desire; hatred (dvesa) is of two kinds: bad hatred (mithyadvesa) and simple hatred; delusion (moha) is of two kinds: bad delusion (mithyamoha) and simple delusion Beings who are the victims of the three kinds of bad poisons (mithyavisa) are difficult to convert and save; those who are victims of the three kinds of simple poisons are easy to save When the Prajnaparamitasutra speaks here of eliminating the name of the three poisons, it is a matter of eliminating the name of the three bad poisons As for the five expressions: Good is generosity! (sadhu danam), etc302 [used here by the sutra], see what has been said above (p 504-506F) in the Fang-kouang chapter (Rasmipramoksa) Saddharmavipralopa Second Section PREVENTING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE HOLY DHARMA Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 34, l 16-17; Satasahasrika, p 114, l 11-12) - The bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes that, after his parinirvana, there will be neither the disappearance of the Holy Dharma nor [313a] even the name of this disappearance (Kim iti me parinirvrtasya saddharmantardhanam na bhaved antardhanasabdo pi na baved iti prajnaparamoitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - <2348> Question - If even the Buddha who is the king of the Dharma must disappear, why should his Dharma not disappear? Answer - As I have already said above, this was a wish (pranidhana) of the bodhisattva, but is not itself realizable 302 The series of approvals introduced by sadhu is a stock phrase, present in the Prajnaparamita sutras in the form of many variations: cf Pancavimsatim p, 10,l 7-8; 34, l 14-15; Satasahasrika, p 19, l 7-8; 114, l 8-9 The formula of Samghabheda, I, p 73, l 19-20 (sadhu damah sadhu samyamah sadhv arthacaryah sadhu kusalacaryah sadhu kalyanacaryah) is almost the same as that of Mahavadanasutra, ed E Waldschmidt, p 128, For the Pali wording, more developed, see Digha, II, p 28, l 31-33 19461) All conditioned dharmas (samskrtadharma) are the result of a complex of causes and conditions (hetupratyayasamagrisamutpanna); how then would they subsist eternally (nityastha) and not perish? The Buddha is like the full sun and the Dharma like the light that remains at the setting of the sun; why would this remaining light at sunset not disappear? It is only because the Dharma lasts for a long time and nobody sees it disappear that it is said not to disappear 2) Moreover, the bodhisattva [of whom the Prajnaparamitasutra is speaking here] sees that among the Dharmas preached by the Buddhas, some remain for a long time (cirasthitika) and others do not Thus the Dharma of Buddha Kásyapa lasts seven days; the Dharma of Buddha Sakyamuni lasts for a thousand years303 This is why the bodhisattva makes the following wish: Although my Dharma is conditioned (samskrta), I wish that it will be prolonged and not disappear, like fire (agni) that, on finding fuel (indhana), continues uninterruptedly 3) Moreover, the Dharma of the Buddhas is the true nature of dharmas (dharmanam dharmata) Now this true nature is without production (anutpada), without destruction (anirodha), without interruption (anuccheda), without permanence (asasvata), without one-ness (anekartha), without multiplicity (ananartha), without coming (anagama), without going (anirgama),304 without grasping (anupadana), without agitation (aninjya), without attachment (asanga), without support (anasraya), non-existent (asat), like nirvana Dharmata being like that, how could it disappear (antardhana)? Question - Dharmata being like that, all the buddhadharmas are necessarily without destruction (anirodha) Answer - Defined in this way, the true nature of dharmas (dharmanam dharmata) is indestructible Nevertheless, there are people who, out of false conceptualization (samkalpa),305 grasp characteristics in things <2349> (dharmesu nimittany udgrhnanti) - characteristics of cessation, etc (vinasadilaksana) - and resort to dualistic theories, believing in disappearances (antardhana) But in the true nature of things (dharmanam dharmata) there is no disappearance 4) Finally by practicing the obstacle-free (anavaranadharma) prajnaparamita, the bodhisattva accumulates immense qualities (aprameyaguna) and, conforming to his original vow (purvapranidhana), his Holy Dharma continues [in time] and nobody sees it disappear However, everything happens like the shooting of the bow and arrow: when the archer shoots an arrow up into the air, the arrow goes far and, even though nobody sees it disappear, it necessarily finally drops306 Buddhanamasravana 303 After Sakyamuni’s parinirvana, his Dharma persists for a thousand years: the Dharma properly called (saddharma, tcheng-fa) lasts 500 years and the counterfeit Dharma (pratirupakadharma, siang-fa) for another 500 years On the disappearance of the Holy Dharma of Sakyamuni, see details in Lamotte, Histoire de bouddhisme indien, p 210-222 304 These are the eight not’s’ of Nagarjuna: cf p 326F; 1638F, n4 305 Here again Kumarajiva uses the characters yi-siang-fen-pie to translate samkalpa 306 An example already used above, p 1261F 1947Third Section BRINGING INNUMERABLE BEINGS TO ABHISAMBODHI BY HEARING THE NAME OF THE BUDDHAS PRELIMINARY NOTE This is the last wish formulated by the bodhisattva presented here by the Prajnaparamitasutra This is a bodhisattva who has made the resolution (cittotpada) to attain abhisambodhi some day and, by virtue of that, to become fully and completely enlightened The sutra gives neither the name of this bodhisattva nor the name he will take once he becomes buddha The bodhisattva formulates the following wish: When I shall have attained abhisambodhi, may beings living in each of the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges also be settled into abhisambodhi as soon as they hear my name Only the hearing of the name (namadheya) is required; there is no question of meditation or of recollection (anusmrti) of the name or of vocal invocation In order to realize this wish, the bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom (prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam), ie, conceive it and practice it in the spirit of the prajnaparamita From the point of view of relative truth, this wish is unrealizable No buddha has ever saved all beings at one time, whether by the hearing of his name or by any other means The proof of this is that in the innumerable universes distributed throughout the ten directions, buddhas have appeared, now appear, and will appear forever in order to save beings from old age, sickness and death If the whole world had been saved once and for all, the appearance of buddhas would be useless On the other hand, from the point of view of absolute truth, the wish formulated here by the bodhisattva is completely realizable; furthermore, it has already been realized How does the bodhisattva practice it? By practicing the prajnaparamita What is there to say? The answer is given to us by the sutra itself (Pancavimsati, p 38, l 16-39, l 1; Satasahastika, p 119, l 18-120, l 5): Tatha hi krtrimam nama pratidharmam / te ca kalpitah / agantukena namadheyena vyavahriyante / tani bodhisattvah prajnaparamitayam caran sarvanamani <2350> na samanupasyaty asamanupasyan nabhivisate / punar aparam Sariputra bodhisattvah prajnaparamitayam carann evam upapariksate namamatram idam yaduta bodhisattva iti / namamatram idam yaduta bodhi iti / namamatram idam yaduta prajnaparamiteti / namamatram idam yaduta prajnaparamiayam caryeti / Actually the name is fictive; it is an anti-dharma; the things [which it designates] are imaginary and expressed by a sound which is foreign to them The bodhisattva engaged in the perfection of wisdom does not consider all these names and, not considering them, does not become attached to them Furthermore, O Sariputra, the bodhisattva engaged in the perfection of wisdom determines this: bodhisattva is only a name, bodhi is only a name, buddha is only a name, prajnaparamita is only a name and the practice of prajnaparamita is only a name 1948That being so, the bodhisattva who wishes to lead all beings to abhisambodhi and buddhahood by the simple hearing of his name is the victim of an illusion, since beings, the buddha, abhisambodhi and the bodhisattva himself are purely imaginary The prajnaparamita, itself only a name, is the absence of all illusion, or in other words, the destruction of wrong views That is the truth! Empty of content though it may be and precisely because it is empty of content, the Truth is liberating: Veritas liberabit vos It is omnipotent and there is no wish that it cannot realize, for the good reason that there is no wish to be realized The buddhas and the great bodhisattvas of the tenth bhumi who have the Prajnaparamita as mother and the Dharmadhatu as body are mingled with the Truth and, like it, are all-powerful The hearing of the name of the buddhas (namadheyasravana) naturally is followed by a reflection (manasikara), more or less prolonged, on these same buddhas, and this reflection is often followed by an oral invocation (akranda), Namo buddhaya The spiritual practice of buddhanusmrti commonly practiced by monks and lay people begins with a settling of the mind (samadhi) on the ten names (adhivacana) of the buddhas (cf p 124-144F; 1340- 1342F): it is placed among the dharmas of the Path leading to nirvana Pure Land Buddhism has been the subject of much research recently The Japanese production has reached unimaginable proportions and H Nakamura has reported on it in Survey of Mahayana Buddhism, Journal of Intercultural Studies, no 3, 1976, p 112-120 The primordial aim of this religious movement has been to assure its adherents a rebirth in the paradise of the buddhas without, nevertheless, excluding access to complete perfect enlightenment at a much later date The method proposed to realize these objectives is presented as being easy and the names of the buddhas plays a major role in it In order to take rebirth in Sukhavati, the Western Paradise, it is necessary first to hear the name of the Buddha Amitabha or Amitayus, but this is only a prior condition Next, it is necessary - and this is essential - to dedicate to it a mind free of any distraction (aviksipta) Opinions differ on the length of this reflection (manasikara) or this commemoration (anusmrti): for some, one single thought (ekacitta), ie, a single mind-moment, is enough; others say that it should continue for ten thoughts, for one day and one <2351> night, for ten days and ten nights, or even that it should be prolonged indefinitely This commemoration sees its efficacy increase if it takes place at the moment of death (see above, p 1534-1539F) and if the ascetic formulates the vow (pranidhana) to be reborn in Sukhavati In return for this, the dying person will see, coming to him, the Buddha Amitabha surrounded by a samgha of bhiksus and bodhisattvas and, after his death, will accede to the Western Paradise However, this favor will be denied to those who have committed the five sins of immediate retribution (anantarya) or who have rejected the Holy Dharma (saddharmapratiksepa): cf the Small Sukhavativyuha, ed U Wogihara, p 202, l 11-19; Large Sukhavativyuha, ed A Ashikaga, p 13, l 22-14, l 8 The Amida soteriology is complex; in it, the hearing of the name and commemoration of the buddhas, the wish to be reborn in the Pure Land, the mind at death, the personal intervention of Amitabha, and the exclusion of the biggest wrong-doings occur in turn The two Sukhavativyuhas, both in their original Indian form as well as in the numerous Chinese and Tibetan versions, have, in time, undergone important 1949revisions, mainly in regard to the number of vows formulated by the bodhisattva Dharmakara when he adorned’ his future buddha-field This composite character in Amidism poses a mass of delicate questions the description of and often the solution to which may be found in K Fujita, Genshi Jßdo Shisß na Kenkyu (Studies on Early Pure Land Buddhism), 1979 In the Chinese and Japanese extensions of Amidism, a growing importance is attached to the oral invocation of Amita See P Demieville, Sur la pensee unique, in BEFEO, XXIV, 1924, p 231-246; G Renondeau, Le Bouddhisme japonais, in Encyclopedie de la Pleiade, History of Religions, I, p 1337-1340: the articles devoted to Amita in Encyclopedia of Buddhism of Ceylon, I, p 434-463 - In the 10th century, Kßya (903-972) traveled through Japan proclaiming the name of the Buddha of the West Incessantly repeated according to Hßnen (1133-1212), piously pronounced only once according to Shinran (1173- 1262), accompanied by dance according to Ippen (1239-1289), the nembutsu became, solely by the power of Amita and in the absence of any merit, the main if not the only means of salvation The adept who pronounces it is assured of being reborn after death in the Western Paradise The nembutsu works its effects ipso facto and infallibly, like a sacrament The bodhisattva whom the Prajnaparamitasutra presents here formulates a wish both more simple and more ambitious, more simple in method - for it is a matter of only the hearing of the name (namadheyasravana) - and also more ambitious in method - for the goal is not to be reborn collectively in the Pure Land, but to establish all beings in the abhisambodhi of the buddhas This goal is attained only in the perspective of the perfection of wisdom, the view of emptiness Is the hearing of the name, like the adoration of the Buddha Amita’ (Nan-wou-a-mi-t’o-fo, namo- amidabutsu) the only means of salvation, infallible and producing its effect immediately by the sole fact of being pronounced? Is it not, amongst many others, an adjuvant to bodhi, useful certainly, but not indispensable, the practice the success of which is not necessarily guaranteed and producing its result only after the event? The question arose for those who had access to sutras of tendencies as different as, on the one hand, the Prajnapamaramitas and, on the other hand, the Sukhavativyuhas This was the case for the author of the Traite who, throughout <2352> his commentary, cites these texts abundantly Forced to take a position, he refuses to recognize the unconditional value of a nembutsu in the hearing of the name Here is what his reasoning will be: 1) The hearing of the name is not the unique means of realizing abhisambodhi The buddhas save beings by various means, the most common of which is preaching the Dharma (dharmadesana) But there are others: emitting rays, performing miracles, spreading perfumes, producing sounds, etc 2) None of these means is infallible, for the capacities and dispositions of beings to be converted must be taken into account Thus, Sakyamuni who appeared in an impure land and at a bad age, increased his preaching but did not always convince his auditors The inhabitants of Magadha criticized him and his cousin Devadatta accused him of charlatanism 19503) It is not enough to hear the word buddha’ in order to obtain bodhi: in order to come to this final outcome, Sudatta and Saila had to receive in addition the admonitions and instructions of Sakyamuni 4) The hearing of the name and access to abhisambodhi are not mingled in one single moment of mind: at the best, the hearing will be the immediate antecedent (anantarapratyaya) to abhisambodhi In conclusion, the hearing of the name does not act as a talisman or a magical formula; it is not the unique and infallible means to realize great enlightenment instantaneously It may be compared to the slight cleavage that makes an already ripe fruit to fall, to the drop of water that makes a vase that is already full to overflow Sutra (cf Pancavimsati, p 34, l 16-18; Satasahasrika, p 114, l 14-16) - The bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he envisages the following: When I attain supreme complete enlightenment, may beings, in each of the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, be established as soon as they hear my name in supreme complete enlightenment (Bodhisattvena mahasattvenaivam upapariksamanena kim iti me nuttaram samyaksambodhim abhisambuddhasya, saha sravanena me namadheyasya, ye dasasu diksu gangana-divalukopamesu lokadhatusu sattvas te niyata bhaveyur anuttarayam samyaksambodhav’ iti prajnaparamitayam siksitavyam) Sastra - I THE TWO KINDS OF BUDDHA Question - Some people are born in a time when one can meet a Buddha and when the Buddha’s Dharma is present; however, sometimes they fall into hell (niraya) This was the case for : T’i-p’o-ta (Devadatta),307 <2353> Kiu-kia-li (Kokalika),308 Ho-to che-tseu (Hastaka Sakyaputra),309 etc 307 Cf p 407F, note 308 The lies of Kokalika followed by his fall into hell have already been noted, p 63F, and told in full, p 806-813FF 309 Above, p 693F, the Traite has already mentioned a certain Ho-to (Hastaka) along with Devadatta The former, I [Lamotte] think, perhaps wrongly, should be replaced by Udraka Ramaputra The transcription Ho-to che-tseu which is found here shows that it is a question of Hastaka Sakyaputra (in Pali, Hatthaka Sakyaputta) distinct from many other Hastakas mentioned in the scriptures and particularly Hastaka Atavika whose story is told above, p 562-565F Hastaka Sakyaputra appears in the Vinayas in regard to the first Patayantika dealing with lying: Pali Vin, IV,p 1-2 (cf Comm of the Dhammapada, III, p 390-391); Mahisasaka Vin, T 1421 k 5 p 37b12-37c6; Dharmaguptaka Vin, T 1428, K 11, p 634a6-634c10; Sarvastivadin Vin, T 1435, k 9, p 63b12-64a5 Here is the transl of the latter source, the most detailed: 1951They fell into hell because the three bad dharmas <2354> (akusaladharma) - raga, dvesa and moha] - covered their minds But then how can the Prajnaparamitasutra say here that, in the absence of the Buddha, in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, it is enough to hear the name of a buddha (buddhanamadheyasravana) to attain abhisambodhi? The Buddha was dwelling at Sravasti At that time in southern India, there was a master in the art of debate; his belly was covered with sheets of copper and he wore a lamp on his head He came to Sravasti and people asked him why he was [armor-clad] in such a way He answered: My wisdom is strong and I am afraid that my belly might burst He was also asked why he carried a lamp on his head and he replied that it was to light up the darkness People said: You foolish brahmana, the sun lights up the whole continent; why do you talk about darkness? He answered: Don’t you know there are two kinds of darkness? One is when the light of the sun and the moon are absent; the other is delusion (moha), when the light of wisdom (prajna) is absent People said: It is because you have not seen the bhiksu Ho-to che-tseu (Hastaka Sakyaputra) that you talk that way If you had seen and heard him, the rising of the sun would be shadows and the night would be the sun-rise Then the inhabitants of the city begged the bhiksu Hastaka Sakyaputra to come and debate with the brahmana Hastaka, hearing this invitation, became despondent but could do no other than to start out for the city On the way, he saw two rams fighting He took this as an omen and said to himself: This ram is the brahmana, this other ram is me Seeing that the ram that represented himself was losing, he became more depressed Following on his way, he saw two bulls fighting and said to himself: This bull is the brahmana, the other bull is myself; here again the bull that represented himself was losing Continuing on his way, he saw two men fighting and he said to himself: This man is the brahamana, that man is myself Again the man representing himself was the loser About to enter the debate hall, he saw a woman carrying a pitcher of water, but the pitcher broke and the water spilled out He thought: I see bad omens: I cannot avoid defeat Nevertheless, unable to do anything else, he entered the house There, on seeing the eyes and the face of the debate master, he understood that he would be vanquished, and his grief was extreme He went to sit down and when it was announced that the debate could begin, he answered: For the moment I am a little sick; wait until tomorrow Having said that, he went [to the Jetavana in Saravasti] where he had a place to live In the last watch of the night (pascime yame), he left to go to Rajagrha The next day, the inhabitants [of Sravasti] gathered together; they waited for Hastaka for a long time but he did not appear The time having passed, they went to the Jetavana and began to look for him (anvesana) The bhiksus [in Jetavana] told them: During the last watch of the night, Hastaka took his robe and his bowl (patracivaram adaya) and went away Hearing this, the citizens blamed Hastaka in many ways (anekaparyayena vigarhanti), saying: How can a bhiksu lie thus? One man told it to a second, the second to a third and so on, and so [Hastaka’s] bad name spread throughout the city Then the bhiksus of little desire (alpeccha) who were simple (alpakrtya) and kept the precepts strictly (dhutavadin) took their robe and bowl and entered the city to beg their food (pinḍaya) Hearing about the affair, they were displeased and after their meal they went to tell the details to the Buddha (tair etat prakkaranam bhagavato vistarenarocitam) Then, for this reason [and in this circumstance], the Buddha called the assembly of bhiksus together (atha bhagavan etasmin nidana etasmin prakarane samgham samnipatayati) He blamed [Hastaka] in many ways, saying: How can a bhiksu lie in this way? Having blamed him in many ways, he said to the bhiksus: In view of ten advantages, I promulgate the following rule for bhiksus (dasanusamsan pratitya bhiksunam siksapadam prajnapayisyami) and from now on this rule must be worded thus (adyagrena caitac siksapadam uddestavyam): If a bhiksu lies knowingly, he commits a patayantika (samprajanamrsavadat patayantika) 1952Answer - Above (p 513F, 1805-1806F, 1818F, 1889F, 1907F, 1940F, 2238F, 2311F, 2322F), I have already said that there are two kinds of Buddhas: i) the Buddha with the body born of the fundamental element (dharmadhatujakaya); [313b] ii) the fictive Buddha (nirmanabuddha) who adapts himself to the sufferings of beings In speaking of the dharmadhatujakaya Buddha, we say that it is enough to hear his name to find salvation; in speaking of the nirmanakaya Buddha who is adapted to beings, we say that in accordance with their karmic cause and conditions, some beings, even though they are dwelling with this Buddha, fall into hell There is no-one that this dharmadhatukakaya buddha cannot save (paritrana), no wish (pranidhana) that he cannot fulfill (paripurana) Why? Because for innumerable (aprameya) incalculable (asamkhyeya) kalpas he has accumulated all the roots of good (kusalamula) and all the good qualities (guna) His omniscience (sarvajnata) is unhindered (anavarana) and complete (sampanna) The devas and the great bodhisattvas rarely see it Like the cintamani, it is hard (durdrsa) to see and hard to acquire (durlabbha) it, but those who do see it have their wishes fulfilled - It is like the sudarsa(?) plant: those who see it escape from all their misfortunes - It is like the cakravartin king: people who see him do not lack wealth (dhana) - It is like Sakradevendra: people who see him obtain <2355> all their desires (yatheccham)310 - It is like Brahmadevaraja: beings who depend on him chase away all their fears (bhaya) People who commemorate (anusmaranti) the name of the bodhisattva Kouan-che-yin (Avalokitesvara) are freed from all danger;311 all the more so if they commemorate the dharmadhatujakaya buddha 310 See Dhvajagrasutra cited above, p 1335-1338F 311 The Traite is referring here to the Saddharmapunḍarika, chap XXIV, p 438, l 5-439, l 2 The bodhisattva Aksayamati asks the Buddha the reasons why the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara is so named The Buddha replies in these words: Iha kulaputra yavanti sattvakotinayutasatasahasrani yani duhkhani pratyanubhavanti tani saced avalokitesvarasya bodhisattvasya mahasattvasya namadheyam srnuyus te sarve tasmad duhkhaskandhat parimucyeran / ye ca kulaputra sattva avalokitesvarasya bodhisattvasya mahasattvasya namadheyam dharayisyanti sacet te mahaty agniskandhe prapateyuh sarve te valokitesvarasya bodhisattvasya mahasattvasya tejasa tasman mahato gniskandhat parimucyeran / sacet punah kulaputra sattva nadibhir uhyamana avalokitesvarasya bodhisattvasya mahasattvasyakrandam kuryuh sarvas ta nadyas tesam sattvanam gadham dadyuh / Burnouf’s translation - O son of noble family, everything that exists in this world of hundreds of thousands of myriads of creatures that suffer pain, all these creatures have only to hear the name of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara to be freed from this great mass of suffering If those who happen to fall into a great mass of fire recall the name of this bodhisattva-mahasattva, they will be delivered from this great mass of fire by the splendor of the bodhisattva- mahasattva Avalokitesvara If, O son of noble family, these beings happen to be carried away by the current of the rivers, if they invoke the bodhisattva-mahasattva Avalokitesvara, all the rivers will provide a ford for these beings immediately - Aside from slight grammatical differences, such as parimucyeyuh in place of parimucyeran, the Gilgit version, ed S Watanabe, p 304, l 6-14, presents the same text According to this passage faithfully rendered in Chinese by Dharmaraksa in 286AD (T 263, k 10, p 128c22- 129a2) and by Kumarajiva in 406 (T 262, k 7, p 56c6-11), a distinction must be made between hearing the name 1953 II HEARING THE NAME OF THE BUDDHAS 1 As a rule, Sakyamuni saves by his preaching Question - The Buddha Sakyamuni also participates in the body born of the fundamental element (dharmadhatujakaya) and is not <2356> different from [the other Buddhas] Then, since he is present in the world, why are there still people who commit the five sins of immediate retribution (anantarya), starving people (ksudhita), thieves (caura) and other miserable people of the same kind? Answer - The original pact (purvabhyupagama) of the Buddha Sakyamuni was the following: I came into a bad age and it is by teaching the Path (marga) that I wish to save beings: I did not come to provide them the happiness of this world (laukikasukha), riches and honors If this Buddha had wanted to use his powers to give them those things, there is nothing he could not have realized Moreover, among people [in the bad age], the power of their merits (punyabala) is slight and the defilements of wrongdoings are heavy: this is why they do not find deliverance as they wish (yatheccham) Moreover, the Buddha at present teaches only pure nirvana and nevertheless, people blame and criticize him: [Criticisms of the Magadhians]312 - They said: Why does the Buddha <2357> make so many disciples and convert (nayati) the populace? That is bondage (bandhana) as well (namadheyasravana, wen-ming) which liberates from the mass of suffering, its memorization (dharana, tch’e) which protects from fire, and its invocation by loud cries (akranda, tch’eng) which saves from water Here the Traite speaks only of those who commemorate’ (anusmaranti, nien) the name of Avalokitesvara In the main meaning of the word, anusmrti is a mental act and not a vocal act The Traite recognizes that those who commemorate the name of the great bodhisattva escape from dangers but, different from the Lotus, it does not say that they are liberated from the mass of suffering (duhkhaskanda), a liberation which is none other than nirvana, vimukti Rather, it notes that recourse to Avalokitesvara, profitable though it may be, is less efficacious than calling upon these depersonalized buddhas that are the dharmadhatujakaya 312 The numerous conversions carried out by the Buddha since his first sermons did not fail to provoke displeasure and criticisms: Pali Vin, I, p 43: Tena kho pana samayena abhinnata-abhinnata Magadhika kulaputta bhagavati brahmacariyam caranti manussa ujjhayanti khiyanti vipacenti: aputtakataya patipanno samano Gotamo, vedhavyaya patipanno samani Gotamo, kulupacchedaya pautipanno samano Gotamo idani anena jatilasahassam pabbajitam, imani ca aḍḍhateyyani paribbajakasatani Sanjaayani pabbajitani, ime ca abhinnata-abhinnata Magadhika kulaputta samane Gotamo brahmacariyam carantiti api ’ssu bhikkhu disva imaya gathaya codenti: agato kho mahasamani Magadhanam Giribbajam / sabbe Sanjaye netvana, kam su dani nayissatiti // 1954When the Buddha converts just by preaching the Dharma, people already criticize him; what would they not say if he indiscriminately distributed the happiness of the world (lokasukha)? [Criticisms of Devadatta]313 - Wanting to have the mark of the thousand-rayed wheel (sahasrara cakra) on the soles of his feet (padatala), Devadatta had an iron (ayas) mold made, had it heated and cauterized his Foucher’s translation - At that time, many young people of good family in the land of Magadha embraced the religious life one after another under the direction of the Blessed One The populace murmured and became angry: The sramana Gautama aims to bring about the absence of children, to bring about widowhood, to bring about the extinction of the family He has just ordained as monks the thousand anchorites (jatila), then the two hundred and fifty monks of Sanjaya, and now many young people of noble family in Magadha one after another are embracing the religious life under the direction of the sramana Gautama And when these people saw the bhiksus, they wanted to quarrel with them with this stanza: The great sramana has come To the capital of the land of Magadha; He has converted all the disciples of Sanjaya; Whom will he convert today? - On the same subject, see also Catusparisad, p 394 and Mahavastu, III, p 90 313 Here the Traite gives a version augmented by an episode told by the Mulasarv Vin: Samghabheda, II, p 165-165; T 1450, k 18, p 191c20-192a7: Punar api devadattah ajatasatroh katayati: tvam maya rajye pratisthapitah: tvam api mam buddhatve pratisthapaya iti; sa kathayati: bhagavatah cakrankapadatalacihnata laksanam asti; tava tu cakrankapadatalacihnata nati iti; sa kathayati: aham cakrankapadatalacihnam abhinirvartayami iti; tena ayaskara ahuya uktah: saksyatha mama padatale cakrankam kartum? iti; te kathayanti: arya saknosi vedanam sodhum iti; sa kathayati: kuruta, saksyami iti; te samlaksayanti: balavan esah; yady evam evankyamah, sthanam etad vidyate yat parsnipraharena asman jivitad vyaparopayisyati; iti taih kantham chidrayitva uktah: arya anena kanthachidrena padau pravesaya iti; tena kanthadhidrena padau pravesitau; ayaskarir agnivarnam cakram krtva padav ankitau; sa duhkam tivram kharam katukha, amanapam vedanam vedayate; bhiksubhih kokalikah prstah: kutra devadattah? sa kathayati: amusmin pradese cakrankapadacihnatam abhinirartayati iti; bhiksavas tam pradesam gatah; tair asau sruto duhkhavedanarto vikrosan; te bhagavatsakasam upasankrantah Transl - Furthermore, Devadatta said to Ajatasatru: I have established you in kingship; now in turn you establish me in buddhahood Ajatasatru answered: The Blessed One has the sign of a wheel on the soles of his feet, you do not- Devadatta replied: I will make one and he called some ironworkers and asked them: Can you make me the mark of a wheel on the soles of my feet? The answered: Yes, Lord, if you are able to withstand the pain - Do it then, said Devadatta, I will withstand it The ironworkers commented as follows: This man is strong; if we mark him in this way, it is possible that with one blow of his heel, he can take our lives And so, having made a hole in the wall, they said to Devadatta: Lord, put your two feet through this hole in the wall This Devadatta did, and the ironworkers heated a wheel white- hot and marked his two feet Devadatta felt the sharp, violent, biting, unpleasant feeling The bhiksus asked Kokalika: Where is Devadatta? Kokalika answered: In a certain place, he made the mark of the wheel on the soles of his feet The bhiksus went to that place and heard Devadatta who was howling with pain The bhiksus went to the Blessed One 1955feet withy it Wounded by the cauterization, he was howling with pain Ananda heard him, burst into tears and said to the Buddha: My brother is going to die; may the Buddha save him out of pity! The Buddha extended his hand and felt Devadatta’s body, uttering this oath of truth (satyopayacana): If it is true that I consider Rahula and Devadatta equal [in my affection], may Devadatta’s suffering disappear Immediately Devadatta’s pain disappeared Devadatta grasped the hand [extended to him], examined it and recognized that it was the hand of the Buddha Then he made the following statement: The son of Suddhodana assures his livelihood (jivitam kalpayati) by this medical trick314 The Buddha said to Ananda: Do you see Devadatta? How could he be saved when he nourishes such feelings? [313c] - The people of the fortunate ages do not have such faults (dosa), but a being like Devadatta cannot be saved by the happiness of this world (lokasukha) All kinds of stories (nidana) on this subject have been told in full above (p 868-878F) 2 The Buddhas do not save solely by the hearing of their name Furthermore, the bodies of the Buddhas are innumerable (aprameya), incalculable (asamkhyeya) and dissimilar in aspect (nanavidhakara): 1) There are Buddhas who, by preaching the Dharma (dharmadesana) to beings, make them obtain abhisambodhi 2) There are Buddhas who emit immense rays (apramanarasmin <2359> pramocayanti) and the beings who encounter them obtain abhisambodhi315 314 Compare Samghabheda, II, p 94: Tato Bhagavata gajabhujasadrsam bahum abhiprasarta grdhrakutam parvatam bhittva  karam devadattasya sthapayitva satyopayacanam krtam: yena satyena yatha rahulabhadre priye ekaputrake cittam amunanadhikam tathaiva devadatte tena satyena ruja samam gacched iti satyopayacanakalasamanantaram eva devadattasya ruja prasanta sa  bhagavatah panim niriksate  ;

you will be able to ensure your livelihood by it On the Buddha’s gesture of passing his hand across a wall or a rock face to cure Devadatta or to reassure Ananda frightened by a vulture, cf Si-yu-ki, T 2087, k 9, p 921b8-15; Fa hien tchouan, T 2085, p 862c21-24; A Foucher, AgbG, I, p 497-499 and fig 249 315 See p 456F 19563) There are Buddhas who, by their superknowledge of magic (rddhyabhijna) and their miracles (pratiharya) direct the minds of beings, and the latter obtain abhisambodhi 4) There are Buddhas who show only their form bodies (rupakaya) and beings obtain abhisambodhi316 5) There are Buddhas who emit sweet perfumes from all their hair-pores (romakupa) and the beings who smell them obtain abhisambodhi317 6) There are Buddhas who, by giving food to beings, make them obtain abhisambodhi 7) There are Buddhas whom it is sufficient to commemorate (anusmaranamatrena) to obtain abhisambodhi 8) There are Buddhas who, by the sounds (sabda) made by plants (trnakastha), do the work of the Buddhas (buddhakarya) and lead beings to obtain abhisambodhi318 9) There are Buddhas whose name people hear (namadheyam srnvanti) and they thus obtain abhisambodhi It is in regard to these Buddhas that the bodhisattva says here: When I become Buddha, may those who hear my name find the Way (uttarana)319 3 The hearing of the name alone is insufficient to produce abhisambodhi Moreover, the hearing of the name (namadheyasravana), by itself, is not enough to obtain abhisambodhi After having heard the name <2360> [of the Buddhas], one practices the Path and only afterwards does one obtain the way (uttarana) [Sudatta’s bodhi]320 - Thus the eminent (sresthin) Siu-ta (Sudatta) first heard the name of the Buddha, rejoiced in his heart, went to the Buddha, heard the Dharma and thus obtained bodhi 316 Sakyamuni showed his tongue and his cryptorchidia to the brahmanas Ambattha, Brahmayu and Sela (cf p 275F, n 1: 1667F) his chest and his armpits to the nirgrantha Satyaka (p 1665-66F, and notes) 317 When the buddha Amitabha, in the form of the bhiksu Dharmakara, carried out the bodhisattva practices, a lotus perfume came from all his pores of his skin and all kinds of food and drink flowed from the palms of his hands Cf Large Sukhavati, ed A Ashikaga, p 25-26: Tasya sarvaromakupebhya utpalaghandho vati sma ; savannapanakhadyabhojyalehyarasabhinirharah sarvopabhogaparibhogabhinirharas ca panitalabhyam prasyandantah pradurbhavanti sma 318 In Amitabha’s paradise, the trees shaken by the wind produce articulated sounds, sweet and enchanting, which serve as predictions Cf Large Sukhavati, p 32: Vatena preritanam ca vrksanam valgumanojnanirghoso niscaraty asecanako pratikulah sravanaya 319 Here tou may be rendered by safety’ but the translation way’ or passage’ is less compromising The character tou serves to translate the Sanskrit words paramita and uttarana: cf G M Nagao, Index to the Sutralamkara, II, p 234a 320 Sudatta, better known by he name of Anathapinḍada (in Pali, Anathapindika), heard a friend pronounce the word buddha’ three times, but that was not the reason that determined his conversion He attained, not the bodhi of the 1957[Saila’s bodhi]321 - Also, the brahmana Che-yi-lo (Saila) <2361> first heard the name of Buddha’ at the home of the jatila-brahmacarin Ki-ni-ye (Keniya); his mind was overjoyed; he went straight to the Buddha; he heard the Dharma and obtained bodhi <2362> arhats but the fruit of srotaapanna, when, on the next day, the Buddha gave him the graded instructions meant for lay people On the conversion of this famous individual, see the Sudatta sutta in Samyutta, I, p 21-212, and the Samyuktagamas, T 99, no 592, k 22, p 157b18-158b23; T 100, no 186, k 9, p 440b2-441a26; the Pali Vin, II, p 154-157; the Mahisasaka Vin, T 1421, k 25, p 166b9-167b4; the Dharmaguptaka Vin, T 1428, k 50, p 938b20- 939a27; the Sarv Vin, T 1435, k 34, p 243c20- 244b15; the Mulasarv Vin, Samghabheda, ed Gnoli, I, p 166-170, and Sayanavastu, ed R Gnoli, p 14-18 Having come to Rajagrha on business, Sudatta went to his brother-in-law Rajagrhaka and found him in the midst of preparing a fine banquet He asked if he was celebrating a wedding or of he was getting ready to receive king Bimbisara His brother-in-law replied with these words: I am not celebrating a wedding and I am not receiving king Bimbisara; however, I am preparing a big sacrifice because tomorrow I have invited the samgha with the Buddha at its head (api ca me mahayanno paccupatthito, svatanaya buddhapamukho samgho nimantito) Did you say the Buddha? asked Sudatta Yes, O householder, I did say the Buddha (buddho ti tvam gahapati vadesiti - buddo t’ aham gahapati vadamiti) This question was asked three times and three times the same answer was given Then Sudatta ended: The word buddha’ is indeed rare in the world (ghoso pi kho eso dullabho lokasmin yad idam buddho buddho ti) But as the Traite comments here, Sudatta heard it three times but did not take immediate advantage of it He wished to go immediately to the Buddha who was then in the Sitavana near Rajagrha Thinking that the time was inopportune, his brother-in-law advised him to wait until tomorrow Sudatta was so impatient to meet the Teacher that he woke up three times during the night thinking that it was dawn Finally the gates of the Sitavana were opened and Sudatta saw the Buddha who was seated and who invited him to approach Sudatta fell down at his feet After exchanging salutations, the Teacher explained the graded teachings to him (anupurvi katha): he spoke to him about generosity, morality and heaven; he explained the dangers of desire and the benefits of renunciation; he ended his sermon with the four noble truths It was only then that the dust-free stainless eye of the Dharma arose in Sudatta (virajam vitamalam dhammacakkhum udapadi): this is the expression dedicated to designate, not accession to abhisambodhi or even the bodhi of the arhats, but simply the attainment of the first fruit of the religious life, the fruit of srotaapanna It does not appear that in his lifetime Sudatta ever attained arhathood Proof of this is that after he died he was reborn among the gods: the Anathapinḍika of the Samyutta, I, p 51-56, speaks of a Sudatta devaputta (§ 6) and an Anathapinḍika devaputta (§ 10) Therefore, according to the canonical sutras, it is not sufficient to hear the word buddha’ in order to be settled, by that very fact, in supreme complete enlightenment 321 The conversion of Saila (in Pali, Sela) is told, partially in the same words, by the Selasutta of the Suttanipata, p 102-112, and of the Majjhima, II, p 146 - See also the Tseng yi a han, T 125, k 46, p 798a25-799c16 The jatila master Keniya was living at Apana, the capital of the Anguttarapas in the land of Anga He was a staunch brahmanist but, coming to learn that the Buddha along with 1250 bhiksus was traveling in the area, he went to see him and invited him to lunch on the following day According to his custom, the Buddha accepted by remaining silent and Keniya went home to prepare the reception with his friends and family 1958These texts say only that [Sudatta and Saila] heard the name’ The hearing of the name (namadheyasravana) is a cause and condition (hetupratyaya) for obtaining bodhi but is not bodhi 4 The hearing of the name and abhisambodhi are not simultaneous322 Keniya had as a friend in Apana the learned brahmana Sela who was a specialist in the Vedas and auxiliary sciences, an expert in interpreting physical signs and learned in mantras which he taught to 300 disciples The same afternoon, as he was passing by his friend’s home and seeing him so busy, he asked what he was preparing for Keniya answered: The Buddha Bhagavat is in the neighborhood, in the Green Forest, and I have invited him and his samgha to have lunch with me The same dialogue occurred between Sela and Keniya as between Sudatta and his brother-in-law Did you say the Buddha? asked Sela Yes, I did say the Buddha, answered Keniya And Sela cried: The word buddha’ is indeed rare in the world Again this time, the fact of having heard three times the word buddha’ had no more effect on Sela than it had had on Sudatta Nevertheless, curious, Sela together with his 300 students went to the Green Forest and respectfully greeted the Buddha He had plenty of time to discover the thirty-two marks of the Great Man on the body of the Blessed One, including those of the tongue and cryptorchidia (see above, p 274-276F, 1667F) They knew that anyone bearing the thirty-two marks is destined to become a cakravartin king or a fully and completely enlightened Buddha Wanting to be sure that he was indeed in the presence of a Buddha, Sela praised Sakyamuni, for he knew from the very old brahmanas that if one praises them, those who are truly holy, fully and completely enlightened, will reveal themselves (ye te bhavanti arahanto sammasambuddha, te sake vanne bhannamane attanam patukaronti) The pious stratagem worked and, approving of the praises which Sela made in stanzas ringing with piety, Sakyamuni firmly and simply admitted himself to be Sambuddha and, since he was addressing a brahmana, Brahmabhuta Fully convinced, Sela and his disciples asked to be received into the order and on the spot they were given ordination This was not yet bodhi, but they entered the Path The next day, the Buddha and the samgha went to Keniya the jatila and took part in the banquet he had offered them After the meal, the Buddha thanked his host and departed Shortly afterward, Sela and his companions realized in this very life the supreme goal of the religious life and recognized that they had destroyed rebirth: Khina jati Thus there were on this earth some new arhats (annataro kho panayasma Sela apariso arahatam ahosi) Sudatta, as we have seen in the preceding note, had to be content with the fruit of srotaapanna Does the fact of having heard the name of Buddha occur in the spiritual conquests? The sutras say nothing about it In any way, if the hearing did have a result, it was not immediate When the new arhats attained the bodhi of the sravakas, eight days had elapsed since the hearing of the name of Buddha and their taking refuge (yan tam saranam agamha ito atthami, cakkhuma; sattarattena Bhagava dant’ amha tava sasane) 322 The hearing of the name and the obtaining of abhisambodhi are not mingled in one and the same moment of mind (eka cittaksana) which, as we have seen above (p 1983F, n 1), is infinitesimal in duration The hearing does not act in the manner of a magical spell instantaneously and infallibly producing its effect 1959Question - However, the Prajnaparamitasutra says here that one hears the name of the Buddha and that at the same time (saha sravanena) one obtains abhisambodhi It does not say that after having heard the name it is necessary to practice the Path in order to finally obtain abhisambodhi Answer - Here the expression at the same time (or simultaneously) does not mean in one and the same mind-moment’ (ekacittena): it only means that there is no intermediary (antara)323 [between hearing the name and abhisambodhi]: that is what the expression at the same time means [Metta sutta]324 - As the sutra says: When the mind of loving-kindness (maitricitta) is cultivated, the seven members of sambodhi (saptasambodhyanga) are cultivated at the same time (sahagata) Objection - But the meditation of loving-kindness (maitrisamadhi) is impure (sasrava), for it has beings as object (sattvan alambate); how then could one cultivate, at the same time, the <2363> seven members of sambodhi (saptasambodhyanga) [which themselves are pure (anasrava)]? Answer - After loving-kindness has arisen, one cultivates the seven members of sambodhi As there are no other dharmas [that are inserted between maitri and the sambodhyangas], we say that they arise at the same time (sahagata) The expression at the same time’ can have two meanings: i) it can designate strict simultaneity (samakala); ii) it can designate posteriority in the long run, provided that no other dharma comes to be inserted between the two terms Here, as it is a mind of maitri and [without any other intermediary (antara)] a practice of the seven sambodhyanas, it is said that they arise at the same time 5 Causes other than the hearing of the name occurring in the obtaining of abhisambodhi325 323 Adopting the variant kien 324 Samyutta, V, p 119, l 3-5: Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu mettasahagatam satisambojjhangam bhaveti // la // mettasahagatam upekhasambojjhangam bhaveti vivekanissitam viraganossitam nirodhanissitam vossaggaparinamim - Here, O monks, the bhiksu [who cultivates maitri], by that very fact cultivates the smrtisambodhyanga going with maitri’; he cultivates by that very fact the [dharmapravicayas, virya, priti, prasrabdhi, samadhi] and upeksa- sambodhyanga going with maitri’, dependent upon separation, detachment, destruction, and having abandonment as goal This sutra is cited in summary in Kosabhasya, p 146, l 12-14 One cannot take it as an argument to assume the absolute simultaneity of maitri and the sambodhyangas Indeed, maitri marred by belief in the self is impure, whereas the seven sambodhyangas depending on detachment from the world are pure, and the pure practices cannot co- exist with the impure practices The truth is that the development of the sambodhyangas follows the development of maitri immediately and without intermediary (samanantara) Similarly, the obtaining of abhisambodhi follows the hearing of the name of the Buddhas (namadheyasravana) without intermediary, but is not mingled with it 325 The conquest of abhisambodhi comes about with the help of causes and conditions, the main ones being the merits acquired by the ascetic himself and - according to the Greater Vehicle - the grace of the Buddhas By itself, the hearing 1960 1) Furthermore, in some beings the merits (punya) are ripe (pakva) and the fetters (samyojana) are slight (tanu); they will obtain abhisambodhi If they hear the name of the Buddhas, they will obtain it at once 2) Moreover, it is by the power (prabhava) of the Buddhas that they hear and find the way (uttarana) Thus when an ulcer (ganḍa) is ripe and there is nobody to prick it, a very small cause is enough for the ulcer to break by itself When a fruit (phala) is ripe [314a] and there is nobody to gather it, a small breeze is enough to make it fall by itself A new piece of cotton cloth (karpasa), white and clean, easily takes the dye (ranga)326 In regard to men, the Prajnaparamitasutra says here that by hearing the name of the Buddhas they immediately obtain abhisambodhi Another example: when a preta who has taken possession of a man hears the exorcism (mantra) of the hermit (rsi), he abandons his victim and flees <2364> 6 How is the name of the Buddhas spread? Question - But who then spreads the name of the Buddhas beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in a way that beings hear it? Answer - 1) By his miraculous power (rddhibala), the Buddha emits innumerable rays (rasmi) from the pores of his skin (romakupa); on each of these rays there are precious lotuses (ratnamaya padma); on each of these lotuses there sits a Buddha, and each of these Buddhas saves beings by preaching the Holy Dharma (saddharma) and also by saying the name (namadheya) of the Buddhas; this is how the beings hear it See what has been said above (p 456F) in the chapter on Fang-kouang (Rasmipramoksa)327 2) Moreover, according to their earlier vows (purvapranidhana), the great bodhisattvas go to the places where the Dharma of the Buddhas does not exist and there they proclaim the name of the Buddhas, as has been said in the present chapter: this is how beings hear it 3) There are also people of great merit who hear the voice of the Buddhas coming from the sky: this was the case for the bodhisattva Sa-t’o-po-louen (Sadaprarudita)328 of the name would not be able to realize abhisambodhi; it is, nevertheless, the slight cleavage that makes the ripe fruit fall, the drop of water that makes the vase of merits overflow 326 Seyyatha pi nama suddham vattham apagatakaḷakam sammad eva tajanam patiganheyya: Digha, I, p 110, 148; II, p 43, 44: Majjhima, II, p 145; Anguttara, IV, p 186, 213 - Tadyatha suddham vastram apagatakaḍakam rajanopagam range praksiptam samyag eva raagam pratigrhnati: Catusparisad, p 180, 233, 452, 454; Samghabheda, I, p 142, 144: Divyavadana, p 617 327 See also p 1352-1353F 328 For Sadaprarudita, see above, p 1353F and 1354F, n While he was seeking the Prajnaparamita and was staying in a forest, he heard a voice coming from the sky (tena  antariksan nirghosah sruto bhut) that said to him: Go, O son of good family, to the east and there you will hear the Prajnaparamita: cf Astasahasrika, p 927; Pancavimsati, T 223, k 27, p 416a-b; Satasahasrika, T 220, book VI, k 398, p 1059a26 19614) The name of the Buddhas is also heard through the intermediary of deities, through the sounds (ghosa) made by the trees or in dream (svapna)329 5) There are also Buddhas of inconceivable power (acintyabala) who come to proclaim or pronounce it 6) Finally, there are bodhisattvas who take the oath to save all beings This is why they say [the following]: When I attain abhisambodhi, may beings in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, as soon as they hear my name, all realize abhisambodhi But in order to do this, they must practice the perfection of wisdom <2365> Samapti Conclusion Preliminary note - In the course of chapters XLII to LII covering volumes IV and V of the present work, the bodhisattva presented by the Pancavimsati has formulated a series of sixty-two wishes (pranidhana) The latter are in accord with the twofold aim assigned to the bodhisattva at the moment when he produced the mind of enlightenment (bodhicittotpada): realizing abhisambodhi, saving innumerable beings and by this fact, assuring his own benefit (svartha) and that of others (parartha) Most of these vows are realizable by current practices: thus a non-Buddhist can indeed conquer the first five abhijnas by judicious practice of the mental concentrations Other vows are not realizable: it is impossible to bring all beings to abhisambodhi by merely making them hear the name of the Buddhas The six virtues assigned to the bodhisattva (generosity, morality, patience, exertion, concentration and wisdom) are within the range of any person of good will but, since they are still sullied by errors and desires, they produce only worldly fruits and at best lead only to rebirths in the good destinies, among gods or humans To be truly efficacious, these virtues must be practiced in the view of the Prajnaparamita which transforms the virtues into perfections’ (paramita): thus, a gift is perfect when its author sees neither donor nor beneficiary nor thing given It is the same for the other virtues: for a wisdom to be perfect it must have overturned the barriers separating the true from the false Whether they appear to us to be realizable or not, all the vows of the bodhisattva are actually already realized if they are conceived in the perfection of wisdom This Prajnaparamita, also called knowledge of all the aspects’ (sarvakarajnana), is the knowledge of the true nature (dharmata, dharmadhatu) of things, whose sole characteristic is the absence of characteristics’ (ekalaksanam yaduta alaksanam) All beings (sattva), including the bodhisattvas and the buddhas, are empty of me’ and mine’ (atmatmiyasunyata), all phenomena (dharma) are empty of inherent nature and specific nature and, consequently, without origination or cessation The Prajnaparamita that sees 329 In the Great Sukhavati, ed Ashikaga, mention is made of the pleasant voice (valgumanojnanirgjosa) of trees shaken by the wind (p 32) and of beings who, by thinking even for a single moment of mind (ekacittotpadena) of the Tathagata Amitabha, see him in dreams (svapnantaragata) and are reborn in Sukhavati (ibid, p 43) 1962them thus does not see them; this wisdom is a non-wisdom It itself is without inherent nature and character: it is the absence of wrong views In this capacity, it holds the force of truth: There is nothing that it does not penetrate, nothing that it does not realize since there is nothing to penetrate, nothing to realize In their body of truth (dharmakaya) or, using the words of the Traite, in their body born of the fundamental element (dharmadhatujakaya), the Buddhas and great bodhisattvas who are the replica of it, are themselves also all-powerful The non-seeing of beings and phenomena logically involves the destruction of all speech and all practice (sarvavadacaryoccheda) and, even better, the non-functioning (apravrtti), the pacification (upasama) of the mind, which is none other than nirvana But with the example of the Buddha, the bodhisattva is not only a great sage, he is also a great compassionate one (mahakarunika): When the bodhisattva cultivates the Prajnaparamita, he sees that all dharmas are empty and that this emptiness itself is empty; from then on, he abolishes all seeing and acquires the Prajnaparamita free of obstacles Then, by the power of <2366> his great compassion (mahakaruna) and skillful means (upaya), he returns [to samsara] to accomplish meritorious actions (punyakarman) and, as a result of these meritorious actions, there is no wish that he does not fulfill As Vimalakirti says (French transl, p 233), wisdom without skillful means is bondage (upayarahita prajna bandhah), but wisdom associated with means is deliverance (upayasahita prajna moksah) The bodhisattva combines the two The methods put into use by the bodhisattva must suit the dispositions and capacities of the beings to be converted and are, like the latter, innumerable The most direct and most efficient method is samadhi which purifies and clarifies the mind Especially to be recommended is the pratyutpannasamadhi which has been fully discussed above (p 2273-75F) In contrast to prajna, it does not penetrate the true nature of things, but by fixing the mind on the Buddhas of the present, it concentrates it in such a way that prajna is produced The large Perfection of Wisdom sutras dedicate a chapter to Prajna Mother of the Buddhas but remain silent on the Father of the Buddhas The Traite repairs this omission by making the pratyutpannasamadhi the father of the Buddhas The two parents are indispensable but, in the birth, the role of the mother is more painful and more meritorious than that of the father A bird needs two wings to soar in space; samadhi and prajna are required to accede to bodhisattvaniyama (cf p 1797-98F) and to abhisambodhi In the Mahayana they continue to hold the major place that they already occupied in the sravaka system as integral parts of the Path to nirvana A canonical stock phrase (Digha, II, p 81, 84, 91; cf Sanskrit Mahaparinirvana, p 160, 228) emphasizes their importance: Silaparibhavito samadhi mahapphalo hoti mahanisamso, samadhiparibhahavita panna mahapphala hoti mahanisamsa, pannaparibhavitam cittam sammad eva asavehi vimuccati - Cultivated by sila, samadhi bears great fruits, brings great benefits Cultivated by samadhi, prajna bears great fruits, brings great benefits; indeed, the mind cultivated by prajna is completely freed from impurities [And the destruction of the impurities is nirvana] Buddhism has evolved over the course of time but along the lines drawn by the Buddha at the beginning and without ever re-assessing its premises 1963 Question - In the preceding chapters (chap XLII - LII), the bodhisattva wants to acquire various qualities (guna) and formulates the wish (pranidhana) for them All these things are to be realized by a group of various practices (nanacaryasamagri); why then does the Prajnaparamita-sutra, [in place of detailing these practices], only recommend that he practice the prajnaparamita? Answer - 1) The sutra in question is called Prajnaparamita and the Buddha wants to explain it This is why he praises the prajnaparamita chapter by chapter (parivarta) 2) Moreover, the prajnaparamita is the mother of the Buddhas (buddhamatr) <2367> The task (yatna, srama) of the mother is greater than that of the father This is why the Buddha considers prajna as his mother,330 <2369> and the Pratyutpannasamadhi as his father This samadhi can only concentrate the 330 A characteristic trait of the Prajna literature is to present Prajnaparamita as the Mother of the Buddhas’ This figure already appears in the mixed Sanskrit stanzas of the Ratnagunasamsaya, XII, v 1 (ed Yuyama, p 49): Mataya putra bahu santi gilanikaya te sarvi durmanasa tatra prayujyayeyuh / em eva buddha pi dasaddisi lokadhatau imu prajnaparamita matu samanvaharanti // If a mother of many sons falls sick, all these sons are saddened and busy themselves around her to tend her In the same way also, the Buddhas in universes of the ten directions busy themselves around the perfection of wisdom, their mother The medium and the large Prajnas dedicate a chapter to the Mother of the Buddhas, sometimes under the title of Lokasamdarsanaparivarta, sometimes under that of Buddhamatr-parivarta: Astasah, ed Wohihara, XII, p 529: Lokasamdarsana - T VII, no 220, XII, p 814b: Lokasamdarsana Astadasadah,T VII, no 220, XV, p 601c: Lokasamdarsana Pancavimsatisah, T VIII, no 223, XLVIII, p 323a: Buddhamatr - T VII, no 220, XLVI, p 224c: Buddhamatr Satasah, T VI, no 220; XLI, p 552c: Buddhamatr The following are some extracts of the Astasah, ed Wogihara, p 529 et seq: Atha khalu Bhagavan punar apy ayusmantam Subhutim amantrayate sma / tadyathapi nama Subhute strya bahavah putra bhaveyus  pralujyate va / evam iyam Subhute prajnaparamita tathagatanam  asya lokaasya samdarsayatri / Transl - Then the Blessed One said to venerable Subhuti: O Subhuti, it is like a woman who has many sons; if she falls sick, all her sons expend great effort to remove all danger of death from their mother Why? Because, they say, we have been brought up by her; she has accomplished difficult tasks for us; for us she is the giver of life and the revealer of the Loka (taken here in the sense of world’) Similarly, O Subhuti, the Tathagatas have the same regard for this Prajnaparamita Why? Because she is the mother, the parent of the Tathagatas; for us she is the indicator of Omniscience and the revealer of the Loka (a designation here of the five skandhas) <2368> Subhuti - How, O Blessed One, is the Prajnaparamita the revealer of this Loka for the Tathagatas, and what is this Loka mentioned here by the Tathagatas? The Blessed One - What is called Loka here by the Tathagata is the five skandhas, namely, form, feeling, conception, formations and consciousness 1964 Subhuti - How, O Blessed One, are the five skandhas designated here by the Prajnaparamita of the Tathagatas, or what is it that is designated by the Prajnaparamita? The Blessed One - The five skandhas, as long as they are not broken or disintegrated, are designated here by the Prajnaparamita by the name of Loka What does that say? They are designated as not breaking up and not disintegrating Indeed, O Subhuti, since the five skandhas do not exist in inherent nature, they have emptiness as nature, and this very emptiness does not break up, does not disintegrate Thus the Prajnaparamita of the Tathagatas is the revealer of the Loka [understood in this way] And the signlessness, the wishlessness, the inactivity, the non-arising, the non-existing, the fundamental element, they also, do not break up, do not disintegrate Therefore, O Subhuti, the Prajnaparamita of the Tathagatas is the revealer of the Loka [understood in this way] Loving sons watch over their mother who has given birth to them and brought them up into the Loka; in the same way, the Buddhas consider their mother to be the Prajnaparamita from whom they derive and who reveals to them the Loka (lokasamdarsayitri) The word Loka, which means free space, the world, people, etc, is derived from the root loki, which means a light, a lamp (loki bhasayam diptau ca), to which are related the Latin lux, the Greek leukos, etc In contrast, an imaginary etymology of ancient date derives Loka from the root luji or ruci, meaning to break into pieces or, in the passive, breaking up (ruci bhanga) Thus in some Buddhist texts, Loka, meaning breakage, has become synonymous with skandha, the five psychophysical aggregates of existence: form, feeling, conception, formations and consciousness In the Kosabhasya, ed Pradhan, p 5, l 15-16, we read that the skandhas are also suffering (duhkha), origin (samudaya), Loka, subjects of false views (drsthana) and existence (bhava) They are Loka insofar as they break up (lujyata iti lokah) On this subject, Hinayanists and Mahayanists are diametrically opposed 1) The former, with rigorous orthodoxy, believe that the skandhas break up The Buddha has repeated again and again in the sutras: That which is impermanent (anitya), suffering (duhkha), subject to change (viparinamadharman) cannot be said to be mine’, cannot be said to be me’ (see references, p 19197F) He also said: Yan tam jatam bhutam samkhatam palokadhammam tam vata ma palujjiti, n’etam thanam vijjati: It is impossible that everything that is born, that has become, that is conditioned and subject to be broken, does not break up Cf Vin II, p 118, 144, 158, 163; Sanskrit Mahaparinirvana, p 402, 408 He also said that the Loka ie, the skandhas, are called thus because it breaks up (Samyutta, IV, p 52: Lujjatiti kho tasma Loko ti vuddati) and that this Loka (rupa, etc) is an an empty Loka, empty of me’ and mine’ (Samyutta, IV, p 54; Sunno loko  attena va attaniyena va) In a word, starting from impermanence, the breakage’ of the skandhas, the Hinayanists arrived at their Emptiness (sunyata) 2) On the other hand, the Mahayanists affirm that the skandhas are called Loka inasmuch as they do not break up and do not disintegrate Not that these skandhas are eternal, far from it These conditioned skandhas do not break up because they never existed, existing only in the imagination of fools Without intrinsic nature, they have as nature emptiness (sunyata), and this emptiness, just like the other unconditioneds, animitta, apranihita, etc, does not exist at all <2369> Also when the Prajnaparamita, the mother of the Buddhas, is presented as the revealer of the Loka’ (lokasamdarsayitri), it should be understood as the revealer of the true nature of the skandhas which is none other than 1965distracted mind (viksiptacitta) in such a way that prajna is produced, but it cannot see the true nature of things (dharmanam dharmata) The Prajnaparamita can see dharmas completely and discern their true nature; there is nothing that it cannot penetrate, nothing that it cannot realize; its qualities (guna) are so great that it is called mother Also, although the yogin who cultivates the six perfections (paramita) and a group of many qualities is able to realize all his wishes, the Prajnaparamitasutra says only that he must practice the prajnaparamita 3) Furthermore, as will be said in a following chapter: Without the Prajnaparamita, the other five paramitas are not called perfections331 Even by [314b] cultivating all the practices (carya) one does not completely fulfill (paripr) the wishes: it is like colored drawings which, without glue (gavyadrdha), are not usable If even in the course of beginningless (anadikalika-samsara) samsara, beings who cultivate generosity (dana), morality (sila), patience (ksanti), exertion (virya) dhyana and wisdom (prajna) obtain the mundane fruits of retribution (laukika vipakaphala), these again will revert to nothing Why? Because prajnaparamita is missing in them But now, it is with the help of the Buddhas (buddhopakara) and with prajnaparamita that these beings cultivate these six things [generosity, morality, etc], and this is why these the absence of any nature The expression lokasamdarsayitri is translated literally by Kumarajiva (T 223, p 323b4): neng-che-che-kien; Hiuan-tsang (T VII, no 220, p 224c13) renders it by a periphrasis neng che che kien tchou fa che siang, which gives in Sanskrit, lokadharmatasamdarsayitri revealer of the true nature of the Loka’ Commenting on this passage, the Traite (T 1509, k 69, p 544a19-28) comments as follows: Question - Other sutras [than those of the Prajnaparamita] say that the five skandhas are called loka’ because they break up (lujyante) and disintegrate (pralujyante); Why then is it said here that the Prajnaparamita reveals (samdarsayati) the non-breakage, non-disintegration, non-arising (anutpada), non-cessation (anirodha), etc, of the five skandhas? Answer - The other sutras come under the Hinayana system whereas this one comes under the Mahayana system The Hinayana speaks mainly about impermanence (anityata) and then about the emptiness of dharmas whereas the Mahayana speaks particularly about emptiness (sunyata) of dharmas The Hinayana speaks of impermanence so that beings fear samsara, but in the Mahayana, it is not like that, and that is why it speaks of non-breakage, non- disintegration, etc Here the Buddha himself gives us the same reason: emptiness (sunyata), signlessness (animitta), wishlessness (apranihita) themselves do not break up and do not disintegrate (na lujyante va na pralujyante va), and the Prajnaparamita states that that indeed is the [true] nature of the loka [ie, the skandhas] 331 Tchao-ming p’in, chapter XL of the Pancavimsati where it is said (T 223, k 11, p 302b24-302c3; T 220, book VII, k 505, p 576c23-577a3): O Kausika, the prajnaparamita of the bodhisattvas surpasses the dana-, sila-, ksanti-, virya- and dhyana-paramitas Just as those blind from birth (jatyandhapuursa), be they a hundred, a thousand or a hundred thousand, cannot travel on the road or enter a city without a guide, so, O Kausika, the first five paramitas, if they are separated from the prajnaparamita, are like blind people without a guide, and cannot travel the Path or obtain omniscience O Kausika, if the first five paramitas find the prajnaparamita as guide, then they really have an eye’ and, guided by the prajnaparamita, they have the right to be called perfections’ Compare Astasahasrika, p 384: Yada punah Kausika danam silam ksantir viryam dhyanam ca prajnaparamitaparigrhitam bhavati tada paramitanamadheyam paramitasabdam labhate tada hy asam caksuhpratilambho bhavati pancanam paramitanam sarvajnatamargavataraya sarvajnatanupraptaye 1966are called perfections (paramita) and bring about (sadhayanti) abhisambodhi so that the succession of the Buddhas (buddhaprabandha) will be uninterrupted (asamucchinna) 4) Moreover, when the bodhisattva cultivates the prajnaparamita, he sees that all the dharmas are empty (sunya) and that this emptiness itself is empty; from then on he abolishes all seeing (darsana) and obtains the unhindered (anavarana) prajnaparamita Then, by the power of his great compassion (mahakaruna) and skillful means (upaya), he comes back to accomplish meritorious actions (punyakarman) and because of these very pure actions (parisuddhakarman), there is no wish that he cannot fulfill The other merits (anyapunya) which themselves lack prajnaparamita do not possess this unhindered prajnaparamita How then could one say that in order to realize his wishes, it is enough for him to practice the virtue of generosity (danaparamita), etc? 5) Finally, when the first five perfections - [generosity, morality, patience, exertion and dhyana] - are separated from wisdom (prajna), they do not have the name of perfections (paramita) The first five perfections are like blind men (andha); the prajnaparamita is like seeing (caksus) The first five perfections are like an unbaked clay pot (aparipakva ghata); the prajnaparamita is like a baked clay pot (paripakva ghata)332 The first five <2371> perfections are like a bird (paksin) without its two wings (paksa); the prajnaparamita is like a bird with its wings333 For these many reasons, the Prajnaparamita is able to realize great things This is why it is said that in order to acquire the qualities (guna) and [realize] one’s wishes (pranidhana), it is necessary to practice the perfection of wisdom <2373> 332 The example of a baked clay pot and an unbaked clay pot, already used by the Traite, p 1875F, is taken from the P’i-yu p’in (Aupamyaparivarta), chapter LI of the Pancavimsati (T 223, k 15, p 330a; T 220, book VII, k 444, p 2141a-b Compare Astasah, p 586: Tadyathapi nama Subhute stri va puruso va paripakvena ghatenodaka parivahed veditavyam etat Subhute nayam ghatas ciram anuvartasyate  Kasya hetoh / yathapi nama suparipakvatvad ghatasya / Transl - Thus, O Subhuti, if a woman or a man takes water in an unbaked clay pot, you must know, O Subhuti, that this pot will not last long, that soon it will break and dissolve Why? Because this pot has not undergone firing and so it will be reduced to a simple earthen residue Thus, O Subhuti, if a woman or a man takes water in a well-baked pot, from a stream, a river, a pool, a well or any other reservoir of water, you must know that, when it is carried, the pot will arrive home in good condition and without being damaged Why? Because this pot has been well fired 333 Example used above, p 1930F 1967 CHAPTER XX (2nd series): SETTING OUT ON THE MAHAYANA PRELIMINARY NOTE In Kumarajiva’s Chinese translation (T 223, k 6, p 256c-259c), Chapter XX of the Pancavimsatisahasrika is entitled Fa-ts’iu p’in (Samprastanaparivarta or Setting out’ on the Mahayana) It corresponds to pages 214, l 6 to 225, l 19 of the Sanskrit text edited by N Dutt Under the same title, it is commented on in Chapter XX (2nd series) of the Traite (T 1509, k 49-50, p 409c-419c) Given its importance, it is essential to give its translation here This chapter deals with the stages in the career of the bodhisattva, a complicated subject which has been the object of many studies for a long time Although beginning to be out of date, the studies of L de La Vallee Poussin are still instructive: the article Bodhisattva in Hastings’ Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, II, 1909, p 739-754; La carrière de Bodhisattva, appearing in his translation of the Vijnaptiatratasiddhi, II, 1928, p 721-742 Also very useful are the studies dedicated to the Abhisamayalamkara and the Prajna literature: E Obermiller, The Doctrine of the Prajnaparamita as exposed in the Abhisalmayalamkara of Miatreya, Acta Orientalia, XI, 1932, p 1-133; Analysis of the Abhisamayalamkara, Calcutta Oriental Series, no 27, 1922-43, p 149-179; E Conze, Abhisamalamkara, Serie Orientale Roma VI, 1954; The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom, 1975, p 163-178 The career of the bodhisattva occupies a place of choice in the enormous Japanese production centered on the Mahayana in particular: cf H Nakamura, A Survey of Mahayana Buddhism, Journal of Intercultural Studies, No 3, 1976, p 61, n 1 In the pages that follow, I [Lamotte] will borrow many references to the works of R Yamada, Daijß Bukkyß Seiritsuron Josetsu (An Introduction to the Development of Mahayana Buddhism), 1959; A Hirakawa, Shoki Daijß Bukkyß no Kenkyu (Studies on early Mahayana), 1968, a work condensed by its author in an article entitled The Rise of Mahayana Buddhism, Memoirs of the Research Department of the Tßyß Bunko No 22, 1963, p 57-106 Over time, the stages of the career of the bodhisattva have been the object of numerous classifications I [Lamotte] will mention only those of which the author of the Traite was aware or may have been aware, namely: 1 the four stages or the four practices (carya) belonging to the bodhisattvas, 2 the ten grounds (bhumi) or the ten abodes (vyavasthana) reserved for the bodhisattvas, 3 the ten grounds shared (sadharanabhumi) by adepts of the three Vehicles I THE FOUR BODHISATTVA STAGES OR PRACTICES 1968 1 Four stages are to be traversed during which the bodhisattva becomes successively: <2374> 1) Prathamacittotpadika (tch’ou fa yi) or Mahayanasamprasthita (fa ts’iu ta tch’eng): Bs who produces the mind of Bodhi for the first time and sets out on the Greater Vehicle 2) Satparamitacaryapratipanna (hing pa lo mi): Bs devoted the the practice of the six perfections 3) Avinivartaniya (pou t’ouei tchouan or a wei yue tche): Bs non-regressing up to bodhi 4) Ekajatipratibaddha (yi cheng pou tch’ou or yi cheng so hi): Bs separated by only one lifetime from buddhahood This classification first appeared in the Astasahasrika, probably the oldest of the PP sutras; from there it passed into the large PP sutras (Astadasa, Pancavimsati, Sata) and was repeated with some supplementary explanations in some Mahayanasutras Astasahasrika, ed U Wogihara, p 831 - T VIII, no 224, p 465a24-25 -T VIII, no 225, p 501a3-10 - T VIII, no 227,p 575a19-21 - T VII, no 220, p 849a26-29;

p 46, l 6-7; p 63, l 11-14 and in full detail, from p 46, l 8 to p 63, l 14 1969This classification is different from and independent of the preceding one but, like it, is modeled on the scheme of the sravaka’s career, the adept of the Lesser Vehicle who, after being instructed by the Buddha and after a long period of effort, enters into the path pf nirvana, successively conquers the fruits of srotaapanna, sakrdagamin and anagamin and finally accedes to arhathood There is, thus, a parallelism between the career of the sravaka and that of the bodhisattva, with the essential difference that the former pursues his own benefit (svartha) above all, whereas the latter assures both his own benefit and that of others (parartha) II THE TEN BODHISATTVA GROUNDS OR ABODES Many are the Mahayana texts that arrange the bodhisattva career into ten grounds (dasabhumi, sa bcu, che ti) or ten abodes (dasavyavasthana, rnam par dgod pa bcu, che tchou), but the names attributed the bhumis and the vyvasthanas vary according the schools Five lists are to be taken into account: 1 Ten bodhisattvabhumis, without names or explanations, according to the Mahayanist avadanas (pen yuan), Several texts limit themselves to mentioning the ten grounds: Karunapunḍarika, T III, no 157, p 195c13 - T III, no 158, p 328b19-20 Ta tch’eng pen cheng sin ti kouan king, T III, no 159, p 298c1;

the second part repeats all of these things and comments on them Nothing leads one to suspect that the commentary is a later addition The chapter belongs solely to the Prajna literature It does not appear in the Astasahasrika but does appear in all the large PP sutras Astadasa, T VII, no 220, p 490b2-497b19 1970Pancavimsati, ed N Dutt, p 214, l 6-225, l 19 - T VIII, no 221, p 27a14-29b29 - T VIII, no 222, p 196b8-199a5 - T VIII, no 222, p 196b8-199a5;

altogether it covers pages 63, l 16 to 157, l 13 1) Duraroha, bhumi difficult of access 2) Baddhamana, hindered bhumi 3) Puspamanḍita, bhumi adorned with flowers 4) Rucra, delightful bhumi 5) Cittavistara, stretching the mind bhumi 6) Rupavati, bhumi full of beauty 7) Durjaya, invincible bhumi 8) Janmanidesa, confirmation of birth (?) 9) Yauvarajya, quality of the crown prince 10) Abhiseka, crucial anointment The Mahavastu is alone in proposing this classification of which scholastic Buddhism has no account 4 Ten bodhisattva vyavasthanas (rnam par dgod pa bcu, che tchou), named and explained, in the Avatamsaka in the chapter on the bodhisattvadasavyavasthanas <2376> The Sanskrit names of these ten abodes are given by the Ganḍhavyuha, ed D T Suzuki and HIdzumi, p 84 1) Prathamacittotpadika (tch’ou fa sin): bodhisattva producing the mind of bodhi for the first time 2) Adhikarmika (tche ti): beginner 3) Yogacara (sieou hing): practicing the practices 4) Janmaja (cheng kouei): of noble birth 5) Purvayogasampanna (fang che kiu tsou): without antecedents 19716) Suddhadhyasaya (tcheng sin): animated by high pure resolve 7) Avivartya (pou t’ouei): without regressing 8) Kumarabhuta (t’ong tchen): crown prince [of the Dharma] 9) Yauvarajya (fa wang rseu): quality of crown prince 10) Abhisikta (kouang ting): anointed with crucial anointment This classification is derived from the Avatamsaka and related texts: Avatamsaka, T IX, no 278, p 444c27-446b23 - T X, no 279, p 84a21-85c11 P’ou sa pen ye king, T X, p 449c15-450c27 P’ou sa che tchou hing tai p’in, T X, no 283, p 454c1-456c5 Ta fang kouang tsong tch’e pao kouang ming king, T X, no 299, p 886b15-888b20 Tsouei cheng wen p’ou tchou tch’ou keou touan kie king, T X, no 309, p 967c27-988 5 Ten bodhisattabhumis, according to the Dasabhumikasutra, or Dasabhumisvara, the Sanskrit text of which has been edited by J Rahder, 1926, and by R, Kondß, 1936 1) Pramudita (rab tu dgah ba, houan hi or ki hi): the joyous bhumi 2) Vimala (dri ma med pa, li keou): the stainless bhumi 3) Prabhakari (hod hphro ba can, tseng yao or yen houei): the bhumi of fiery prajna) 5) Sudurjaya (sin tu dbyans dkah ba, nan cheng or ki nan cheng): the bhumi difficult to conquer 6) Abhimukhi (mnon du gyur ba, hien tsai): the bhumi of presence 7) Duramgama, (rin du son ba, chen jou or yuan hing): the far-going bhumi 8) Acala (mi gyo ba, pou tong): the unshakable bhumi 9) Sadhumati (legs pahi blo gros, chan ken or chan houei) the bhumi of good prajna 10) Dharmamegha (chos kyi sprin, fa yun): the cloud of Dharma bhumi This classification, like the preceding one, is derived from the Avatamsaka (of which it forms a chapter) and related texts: Avatamsaka, T IX, no 278, p 542c27-a1 - T X, no 279, p 179b21-24 Dasabhumikasutra, T X, no 285, p 458c18-24 - T X, no 286, p 498b29-c3 - T X, no 287, p 536b3-6 Dasabhumikavibhasa, T XXVI, no 1521, p 21a12-13 Dasabhumikasutropadesa, T XXVI, no 1522, p 127c4-7 <2377> 1972Maitreyapariprccha, T XXVI, no 1525, p 235c19 Upadesa, T XXV, no 1509, p 411a27-29;

Siddhi, transl L de La Vallee Poussin, p 613-619 III THE TEN GROUNDS SHARED BY ADEPTS OF THE THREE VEHICLES Here it is no longer a matter of the grounds reserved for bodhisattvas alone but of four groups of grounds occupied by the sravakas, the pratyekabuddhas, the bodhisattvas and the Buddhas, respectively The list was elaborated in the Prajna school and presents some similarities with that of the ten bodhisattva- vyavasthanas mentioned above 1) Suklavidarsana (dkar po rnam par mthon nahi sa, tsing kouan); ground pf clear seeing - Variant attested by the Satasahasrika, p 1563, l 1, and some Chinese translations: Suskavidarsana (kan houei): level of dry seeing, ie, not moistened by absorption Variant derived probably from a faulty reading: suska for sukla 2) Gotra (rigs kyi sa, sing or tchong sing); ground of the spiritual lineage 3) Astamaka (brgyad pahi sa, pa jen or ti pa): ground of the eighth saint or of the aspirant srotaapanna 4) Darsana (mthon bahi sa, kien or kiu kien): ground of seeing or of srotaapanna 5) Tanu (bsrab pahi sa, po): ground of the reduction of the passions or of the sakrdagamin 6) Vitaraga (hdod chags dan bral bahi sa, li yu): ground of the saint freed from the passions or of the anagamin 7) Krtavi (byas pa bsran bahi sa, yi tso or yi pan): ground of the saint who has done what had to be done or of the arhat 8) Pratyekabuddha: ground(s) of the solitary Buddhas 9) Bodhisattva: the (ten) grounds of the bodhisattva 197310) Buddha: the ground of the Buddhas In this list, only the sravaka grounds, seven in number, are itemized The list does not appear again in the Astasahasrika, but does appear in all of the large PP sutras: <2378> Astadasa, ed E Conze, I, p 183, l 24-25;

In the early scriptures and mainly in the Vinayas and Abhidharmas where these seven sravakabhumis appear in part or in full as has been shown by A Hirakawa, The Rise of Mahayana Buddhism, Memoirs of the Research Department of the Tßyß Bunka, no 22, 1963, p 67-68 The career of the sravaka is strictly called the Path of nirvana traveled by the saints or aryas Leaving aside a preparatory period, it goes from entry into the certainty of acquisition of the supreme good (samyaktvaniyamavakranti) or nirvana up to obtaining the state of arhat During this career, by means of seeing (darsana) and repeated meditation (bhavana) of the noble Truths, the arya gathers the four fruits of the religious life (sramanyaphala) successively, the fruits of srotaapanna, sakrdagamin, anagamin and arhat The career of the sravaka is punctuated with a certain number of stages which some early sources, rather rare it is true, describe also as grounds (bhumi) and which may be placed parallel to the grounds of the bodhisattva As we have just seen, the Prajnaparamita enumerates seven, suklavidarsana, etc, but the early sources (Vinaya and Abhidharma of the Sarvastivadins) are usually content to give a much lower number 1) Two bhumis: Darsana and Bhavana, represented by anajnatamajnasyamindriya and ajnatendriya respectively Cf Mahavibhasa, T XXVII, no, 1545, p 344a3-4; 909c22 - Vibhasa, T XXVIII, no 1546, p 256c9 19742) Three bhumis: Darsana, Bhavana and Asaiksa Cf Mahavibhasa, T XXVII, no 1545, p 740a14; 944a25 - Abhidharmahrdaya by Upasanta, T XXVIII, no 1551, p 849c24-25 - Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya, T XXVIII, no 1552, p 910c6 3) Four bhumis, according to Ghosaka: Tanu, Vitaraga, Asaiksa and Bhumiphala <2379> or Nirvana (cf Mahavibhasa, T XXVII, no 1545, p 137b27-28) or Darsana, Tanu, Vitaraga and Asaiksa (cf Vibhasa, T XXVIII, no 1546, p 114a12-13) 4) Four bhumis according to Parsva: Prayoga (sieou hing ti), Darsana (kien ti), Bhavana (sieou ti) and Asaiksa (wou hio ti) Cf Mahavibhasa, T XXVII, no 1545,p 560c7-8 - Vibhasa, T XXVIII, no 1546, p 398b13-14 5) Six bhumis, according to Katyayaniputra: Prayoga, Darsana, Tanu, Vitaraga, Asaiksa and Bhumiphala or Nirvana Cf Mahavibhasa, T XXVII, no 1545, p 147b29-c3 6) Six bhumis: Gotra, Astamaka, Darsana, Tanu, Vitaraga and Krtavi Cf Vinayamatrka, T XXIV, no 1463, p 801b20-25 It is possible that the large PP sutras may have borrowed this list, putting a sukladarsanabhumi ahead of it Even if that is the case, it would be dangerous to conclude a dependency between the Prajnas and the Vinayamatrka the relationship of which is unknown; for some critics it would be of Haimavata origin; for others, of Dharmagupaka origin Whatever its origin, the list of the ten shared grounds has complicated the career of the bodhisattva in a strange way We may recall that this career begins with the first production of the mind of bodhi (prathamacittotpada) and ends with the arrival at supreme complete bodhi (anuttara samyaksambodhi) It involves a certain number of stages or steps designated by the name of grounds (bhumi) Two groups of grounds are to be distinguished: 1) The grounds proper, ie, reserved for the bodhisattva They are ten in number In the early Prajnas, they are not named, but the Avatamsaka calls them Pramudita, Vimala, Prabhakari, Arcismati, Sudurjaya, Abhimukhi, Duramgama, Acala, Sadhumati, Dharmamegha 2) The shared grounds (sadharanabhumi) belonging to the disciples of the Buddha altogether divided into three groups: i) the sravakas whose grounds are seven in number: Suklavidarsana (variant, Suskhavidarsana), Gotra, Astamaka, Darsana, Tanu, Vitaraga, Krtavi; ii) the pratyekabuddhas whose grounds are not specified in number; iii) the bodhisattvas to whom are reserved the ten grounds proper just mentioned In the following pages, I [Lamotte] will refer to these two groups of grounds by calling them the grounds proper’ and the shared grounds’ The bodhisattva has two ways of accomplishing his career He can travel through the grounds proper (what I [Lamotte] will call the career of grounds proper’, or he can travel though the shared grounds (what I [Lamotte] will call the ’career of shared grounds’) 19751 The career of the grounds proper It is by far the most usual It is described in chapter XX of the Pancavimsati entitled Samprasthanaparivarta (T 223, k 6, p 256c-259c) and commented on in the present chapter of the Traite 2 The career of the shared grounds It has been passed over unnoticed up until now, although it was set out in chapter LVII of the Pancavimsati entitled Chen ngao p’in, or also Teng tchou p’in (Pradipavartiparivarta): cf T 223, k 17, p 346b2-7: <2380> Subhuti asked the Buddha: Bhagavat, what are the ten grounds which the bodhisattva completely fulfills in order to obtain anuttara samyaksambodhi? - The Buddha replied: The bodhisattva who completely fulfills the Suskavidarsanabhumi, the Gotrabhumi, the Astamakabhumi, the Darsanabhumi, the Tanubhumi, the Vitaragabhumi, the Krtavibhumi, the Pratyekabuddhabhumis, the Bodhisattvabhumis, the Buddhabhumi, this bodhisattva, I say, who completely fulfills these bhumis obtains anuttara samyaksambodhi At first sight it seems strange that, in order to accomplish his own career, the bodhisattva begins by fulfilling that of a sravaka but, although initially the practices of the sravaka and the bodhisattva are the same, the mind in which they are performed is quite different The explanations given by the Traite (T 1509, k 75, p 585c25-586a25) merit a translation: In this passage, the Buddha again explains the causes and conditions leading to anuttara bodhi From his first production of the mind of bodhi (prathamacittotpada), the bodhisattva practices the perfection of wisdom (prajnaparamita) and completely fulfills the [shared] grounds, from the first to the tenth These ten grounds help in realizing anuttara bodhi These ten grounds are the Suklavidarsanabhumi, etc 1) Suklavidarsanabhumi - It is of two kinds: i) that of the sravaka, ii) that of the bodhisattva The sravaka, solely in view of nirvana, exerts himself (utsahate) to conquer bodhi Practicing the concentration of contemplating the Buddhas or the contemplation of the ugly (asubhabhavana), practicing loving-kindness (maitri), compassion (karuna) or the reflections on impermanence (anityadatadimanasikara), he accumulates good dharmas and rejects bad dharmas Although he has a certain wisdom (prajna), he is unable to find the water of the dhyana-samapattis nor is he able to obtain Bodhi as a consequence This is why this ground is called the ground of the dry earth - In the bodhisattva who has just produced the mind of bodhi (prathamacittotpada), this stage is prolonged as long as he has not attained the preparatory conviction (anulomiki ksanti) [This stage covers the shared grounds 1 to 5, from Pramudita to Sudurjaya] 2) Gotrabhumi - The sravaka [conquers the four nirvedhabhagiya kusalamula, roots of good leading to penetration of the noble truths], from heat (usmagata) up to the supreme worldly dharmas (laukikagradharma) The bodhisattva, however, obtains the preparatory conviction (anulomiki ksanti) [during the shared ground no 6, Abhimukhi]; he is attached to the true nature of dharmas (dharmanam 1976dharmata), no longer produces any wrong views (mithyadrsti) and obtains the water of the dhyana- samapattis 3) Astamakabhumi - [In the course of this ground, the sravaka] goes from duhkhe dharmajnanaksanti to marge nvayajnanaksanti: these are the first fifteen moments of mind [of the Satyadarsanamarga, or Path of seeing the truths - For the bodhisattva, it is [the definitive obtaining] of the conviction that dharmas do not arise (anutpattikadharmaksanti) and entry into the [definitive] position of bodhisattva (bodhisattvaniyama) [This result is attained in the course of or at the end of the 7th ground proper, the Duramgama] <2381> 4) Darsanabhumi - [For the sravaka], this is the obtaining for the first time of a fruit of sainthood (aryaphala), namely, srotaapanna - For the bodhisattva, it is the bodhisattva ground of non-regressing (avaivartika) [It coincides with the shared ground no 8, the Acala) 5) Tanubhumi - [The sravaka], if he is srotaapanna or sakrdagamin, partially destroys the nine kinds of passions (klesa) of the desire realm: [six categories if he is sakrdagamin] - As for the bodhisattva, passing the non-regressing level Avaivartikabhumi and as long as he has not become buddha [and remains in the grounds proper no 8 and no 9, Acala and Sudarjaya], he destroys all the passions, and the traces (vasana) that remain become very slight (tanubhavanti) 6) Vitaragabhumi - Here, [the sravaka] abandons all the passions, desire, etc (ragadiklesa) of the desire realm (kamadhatu) and is called anagamin - As for the bodhisattva, because of his renunciation (vairagya), he obtains the five superknowledges (abhijna) This corresponds to ground proper no 9, Sudurjaya] 7) Krtavibhumi - [Here] the sravaka obtains the knowledge of the destruction of the impurities (asravaksyajnana) and the conviction that they will not arise again (anutpadajnana), and he becomes arhat - As for the bodhisattva, he completely fulfills the ground of Buddha (buddhabhumi) [coinciding with the shared ground no 10, the Dharmamegha] 8) Pratyekabuddhabhumi - In an earlier existence, he has planted the causes and conditions for the bodhi of the pratyekabuddhas; in the present existence, because of a minor event (see above, p 1068-68F), he has left home (pravrajita) and, having found the profound doctrine of the nidanas (= pratityasamutpada), he has realized the bodhi of the pratyekabuddhas In the language of the Ts’in, Pi-tche-fo is also called Pi- tche-kia-fo 9) Bodhisattvabhumi - This is the [shared grounds] from Sukladarsanabhumi to Krtavibhumi, as has been said above It is also the [shared grounds] going from the Pramudita bhumi to the Dharmamegha bhumi: all are called Bodhisattvabhumi Some say that all the grounds from the production of the first mind of bodhi (prathamacittotpada) to the diamond-like concentration (vajropamasamadhi) are called Bodhisattvabhumi] 10) Buddhabhumi - These are all the attributes of Buddha, beginning with the knowledge of phenomena in all their aspects (sarvakarajnata) In his grounds proper, the comportment (pratipatti) of the bodhisattva is perfect; his vision (vidarsana) of the grounds of another is perfect For these two reasons together, the bodhisattva is perfect (sampanna) 1977- Some critics are surprised that the Traite places the Avaivartika in the fourth stage of the bodhisatva’s career But a distinction is made here: as we will see, the Avaivartika is in the fourth stage (Darsanabhumi) of the shared levels, but at the eighth stage (Acalabhumi) of the grounds proper only The present passage has nothing revolutionary about it; to the contrary, it follows the purest abhidharmic tradition Sutra - Atha khalu bhagavan ayusmantam subhutim etad avocat / yad api subhutir evam aha / katham bodhisattvo mahasattvo mahayanasamprasthito bhavati / iha subhute bodhisattvo mahasattvah satsu <2382> paramitasu caran bhumer bhumim samkramati / ayam bodhisattvo mahasattvo mahayana- samprasthita ity ucyate / athayusman subhutir bhagavantam etad avocat / katham bhagavan bodhisattvo mahasattvo bhumer bhumin samkramati / bhagavan aha / bodhisattvo mahasattvah sarvadharmanam asamkrantim janati / na hi kascid dharmo ya agacchati va gacchati va samkramati va upasamkramati va / api tu bodhisattva ya sarvadharmanam bhumis tam na manyate na cintayati bhumiparikarma ca karoti na ca bhumim samanupasyati / Then the Blessed One said to venerable Subhuti: You also asked me, O Subhuti, how the bodhisattva- mahasattva sets out on the Mahayana Well then, Subhuti, the bodhisattva-mahasattva who, going along with the six perfections, passes from ground to ground is said to have set out on the Mahayana Then the venerable Subhuti said to the Blessed One: How, O Blessed One, does the bodhisattva-mahasattva pass from ground to ground? - The Blessed One answered: The bodhisattva-mahasattva knows the non- passing of all the dharmas; indeed, there is no dharma that comes or that goes, that passes by or that approaches However, the bodhisattva-mahasattva does not think, does not reflect about the level of the dharmas and yet he practices the preparations for the grounds but does not see the grounds Sastra (p 411a16) - Above (Pancavimsati, p 194), Subhuti had questioned the Buddha about the Mahayana, and the Buddha had answered (ibid, p 194-214) by explaining the many characteristics of the Mahayana to him334 Also above (ibid, p 214), Subhuti had asked a question about starting out for the 334 According to the Pancavimsati (p 194-225), the many characteristics of the Mahayana are classified in the following way: 1 the six paramitas (p 194-195) 2 the twenty sunyatas (p 195-198) 3 the one hundred ands twelve samadhis (p 198-203) 4 the twenty-one groups of practices (p 203-212): 1) four smrtyupasthanas, 2) four samyakprahanas, 3) four rddhipadas, 4) five indriyas, 5) five balas, 6) seven bodhyangas, 7) astangamarga, 8) three samadhis, 9) eleven jnanas, 10) three indriyas, 11) three samadhis, 12) ten anusmrtis, 13) four dhyanas, 14) four apramanas, 15) four samapattis, 16) eight vimoksas, 17) nine anupurvaviharas, 18) ten tathagatabalas, 19) four vaisaradyas, 20) four pratisamvids, 21) eighteen avenika buddhadharmas 5 the forty-three dharanimukhas (p 212-214) 1978Mahayana (mahayanasamprasthaÌa) and here also the Buddha answered about the characteristics of this setting out The bodhisattva-mahasattva going in this Vehicle (yanaruḍha) knows that from the beginning (adita eva) all dharmas are without coming (anagama), <2383> without going (anirgama), unmoving (acala) and without setting forth (asamprasthana), because the fundamental element is eternally stable (sthita) Furthermore, by minds of great compassion (mahakarunacitta), by the perfection of exertion (viryaparamita) and by the power of skillful means (upayabala), the bodhisattva returns to practice the good dharmas (kusaladharma) and, still seeking the higher grounds (uttarabhumi),335 he does not grasp the characteristics of these grounds (na bhuminimittany udgrhnati) and does not see these grounds Question - But [in order to answer Subhuti’s question precisely], the Buddha should have spoken here about the Greater Vehicle (mahayanasamprasthana); why then does he speak about setting out for the grounds (bhumisamprasthana)? Answer - The Greater Vehicle is the grounds; [thus, to speak about the grounds is to speak about the Greater Vehicle] The grounds are ten in number; to go from the first to the tenth is to start out’ (samprasthana) Thus a man riding on a horse (asva) who wants to ride on an elephant (hastin), abandons the horse and gets up on the elephant; and to ride on a dragon (naga), he abandons the elephant and mounts the dragon Question - What are the ten grounds? Answer - There are two kinds of grounds: i) the grounds belonging to the bodhisattva (bodhisattvabhumi) alone, ii) the shared grounds (sadharanabhumi)336 The shared grounds go from the ground of dry seeing (suskavidarsanabhumi) to the ground of the Buddhas (buddhabhumi) The grounds belonging to the bodhisattva alone are: 1) the joyous ground (pramudita bhumi), 2) the stainless ground (vimala bhumi), 3) the shining ground (prabhakari bhumi), 4) the ground of fiery wisdom (arcismati bhumi), 5) the ground difficult to conquer (sudurjaya bhumi), 6) the ground of presence (abhimukhi bhumi), 7) the far-gone ground (duramgama bhumi), 6 the ten bhumis (p 214-225) 335 Bhumis 8 to 10 336 See the preliminary note to this chapter 19798) the unshakeable ground (acala bhumi), 9) the ground of good wisdom (sadhumati bhumi) 10) the ground of the cloud of the Dharma (dharmamegha bhumi) For the characteristics of these grounds, see the full explanation in the Che-ti king (Dasabhumika sutra) <2384> Bhumi I 1 Sutra - Katamam ca bodhisattvasya mahasattvasya bhumiparikarma / prathamayam bhumau vartamanena bodhisattvena mahasattvena dasabhumiparikarmani karanitani / adhyasayadrḍhatt- anupalambhayogena / evam ukta ayusman subhutir bhagavantam etad avocat / katamad bhagavan bodhisattvasya mahasattvasyadhyasayaparikarma / bhagavan aha / yad bodhisattvo mahasattvah sarvajnatapratisamyuktais cittotpadaih kusalamulani samuranayati / What is the preparation of the grounds in the bodhisattva-mahasattva? The bodhisattva-mahasattva who is in the first ground should fulfill ten preparations: 1) the strength of his high aspiration by means of the method of non-apprehending Then the venerable Subhuti said to the Bhagavat: For the bodhisattva-mahasattva, what, O Bhagavat, is this preparation consisting of a high aspiration? - The Bhagavat answered: By means of resolutions associated with omniscience, the bodhisattva-mahasattva accumulates the roots of good Sastra (p 411b1) - In order to enter into the first ground, the bodhisattva must accomplish ten things, from high aspiration (adhyasaya) up to true speech (satyavacana)337 Subhuti knows this very well, but in order to cut the doubts (samsaya) of beings on this subject, he questions the Bhagavat and asks him: What is this high aspiration? The Buddha answers: It is to accumulate the roots of good by means of resolutions associated with omniscience In regard to the resolutions associated with omniscience, we may note: When the bodhisattva-mahasattva produces the mind of supreme complete enlightenment for the first time (prathamato nuttarasamyaksambodhicittam utpadayati), he makes the following vow (pranidhana): May I become Buddha in a future lifetime (anagate janmani) Thus this mind of supreme complete enlightenment constitutes a resolution associated with omniscience’ (sarvajnatasamprayukta cittotpada) Associated’ (samprayukta) insofar as it joins the mind to the wish to become Buddha For the bodhisattva of keen faculties (tiksnendriya) who has accumulated merits (punya) greatly, the passions (klesa) are slight (tanu) and the past wrongdoings (atitapatti) are less numerous When <2385> he 337 Compare Abhisamayalamkara, I, v 48-50 (p 7-8); Aloka, p 99 Properly speaking, these ten parikarmas are to be practiced in the course of the prayogamarga preceding entry into the first bhumi 1980produces the mind of bodhi (cittotpada), he forms the high aspiration (adhyasaya) which takes pleasure in abhisambodhi and, from lifetime to lifetime, the concerns about worldly things (loka) decrease: this is what is here called resolutions associated with omniscience’ (sarvajnatasamprayukta cittotpada) In all the virtues that he practices, generosity (dana), morality (sila), concentration (samadhi), etc, the bodhisattva does not seek either the happiness of this world or that of the other world (ihaparalokasukha), or longevity (ayuhpramana) or safety (ksema); he seeks only omniscience (sarvajnata) Just as a miser (matsarin) refuses for any reason to give even a single coin (karsapana), saves them and piles them up with the sole desire of becoming rich, so the bodhisattva, whether his merits (punya) are many or not, seeks nothing other than to save them and pile them up with the view of omniscience Question - But if the bodhisattva does not yet have omniscience and has not yet tasted its flavor (rasa), how can he form the high aspiration (adhyasaya)? Answer - I said above that it is a question of someone of keen faculties (tiksnendriya), of slight passions, of pure qualities, who is not fond of the world Without even having heard the Mahayana praised, he hates the world: what then if he has heard it praised? Thus, Mo-ho-kia-chö (Mahakasyapa) had taken as wife a woman golden in color (suvarnavarna), but as he did not love her, he abandoned her and entered into the religious life338 Also seeing in the middle of the night that his courtesans were like corpses, Ye-chö tch’ang-tchö-tseu (Yasah sresthiputra) left his precious sandals worth a hundred thousand [karsapanas] on the bank of the river, crossed over the river and went straight to the Buddha (satasahasram manipadukayugam nadyavarakayas tire ujjhitva, nadim varakam pratyuttiryayena bhagavams tenopasamkrantah)339 The noblemen and kings who, out of disgust, thus renounced the five objects of enjoyment (pancakamaguna) are innumerable Why then does the bodhisattva, who has heard speak of the many qualities (guna) of the bodhi of the Buddhas, not at once make the resolution <2386> (cittotpada) to penetrate it deeply? Thus, in the chapter Sa-t’o-po-louen (Sadaprarudita-parivarta) which will follow,340 the daughter of a nobleman (sresthidarika), having heard the praises of the Buddha, immediately left her home and went to T’an-wou-kie (Dharmodgata)341 Moreover, as his five spiritual faculties (pancendriya), faith (sraddha), etc, are complete (paripurna) and ripe (paripakva), the bodhisattva is able to acquire the high aspiration (adhyasaya) A small child whose five organs (pancendriya), eye (caksus), etc, are not complete, does not discern the five objects (pancavisaya) and does not distinguish what is beautiful and what is ugly; it is the same when the five spiritual faculties, faith, etc, are not complete: one does not distinguish between the good and the bad, one 338 On the marriage of Mahakasyapa and Bhadra, soon followed by separation, see above, p 287F, n 1 339 On the conversion of Yasas, see above, p 1545F, n 4 To the references, add Samghabheda, I, p 139-141 340 Tch’ang-t’i pin, chapter 88 of the Pancavimsati, T 223, k 27, p 416a-421b 341 In this chapter, the daughter of the sresthin went with her father and mother to the bodhisattva Dharmodgata to pay homage to him - Cf Astasahasrika, ed U Wogihara, p 953: Atha khalu sa sresthidarika Dharmaodgatasya bodhisattvasya mahasattvasya pujartham satkarartham ca prasthita 1981does not know the difference between what is bondage (bandana) and what is deliverance (moksa), one loves the five objects of enjoyment (pancakamaguna) and one falls into wrong views (mithyadrsti) But the person whose five spiritual faculties, faith, etc, are complete is able to distinguish good from bad If already he takes pleasure in the sravaka system advocating the ten good paths of action (dasakusalakarmapatha), why would he not think more deeply yet of supreme bodhi? As soon as he first produces the mind of supreme bodhi, he has already gone beyond the world; he goes even further when he has perfected [this mind of supreme bodhi] Furthermore, when the bodhisattva begins to taste the flavor (rasa) of the Prajnaparamita, he is able to produce the high aspiration (adhyasaya) A man closed up in a dark prison who sees the light through a narrow slit, leaps for joy; he thinks and tells others that he alone has seen such a light and, in his joy and happiness, he produces a high aspiration; thinking of this light, he seeks to escape by any means It is the same for the bodhisattva: closed up in the dark prison of the twelve bases of consciousness (dvadasayatana) and of ignorance (avidya) by his earlier actions (purvakarman), everything that he knew and saw was false; but when he has heard the Prajnaparamita and tasted its flavor a little bit, he thinks deeply about omniscience (sarvajnata) and wonders how to get out of the prison of the six sense organs (saḍindriya), like the Buddhas and the aryas <2387> Finally, when the bodhisattva has produced the mind of supreme complete enlightenment, he acts in conformity with his wish (yathapranidhanam); this is why he produces the high aspiration (adhyasaya) that consists of loving all dharmas, but none as much as omniscience (sarvajnata); of loving all beings, but none as much as the Buddhas; of penetrating deeply into the feelings of compassion (karunacitta) to work for the benefit of all beings (sarvarthakriya): these are the characteristics of adhyasaya In the first ground, the bodhisattva must always practice these resolutions (cittotpada) [associated with omniscience] 2 Sutra - Sarvasattvasamacittataparikarma sattvanupalabdhitam upadaya // yad bodhisattvah sarvajnatapratisamyuktais cittotpadais caturpramanany abhinirharati maitrikarunamuditopeksam / The equality of mind towards all beings by not apprehending any being - By means of the resolutions associated with omniscience, the bodhisattva produces the four immeasurable [feelings]: loving-kindness, compassion, joy and equanimity Sastra (p 411c16) - When the bodhisattva has obtained this high aspiration (adhyasaya), he equalizes his mind in regard to all beings Beings always love their friends and hate their enemies, but, for the bodhisattva who has obtained the high aspiration, enemy and friend are equal; he regards them as the same Here the Buddha himself defines the equality of mind (samacittata) as being the four immeasurable feelings (caturapramana) When the bodhisattva sees beings experiencing happiness (sukha), he produces minds of loving-kindness (maitri) and joy (mudita) and formulates the vow (pranidhana) to lead all beings to find the happiness of a Buddha - When he sees beings undergoing suffering (duhkha), he produces a mind of compassion (karuna) and, out of pity for them, he formulates the vow to eradicate the sufferings of 1982all beings When he sees beings who are neither unhappy nor happy, he produces a mind of equanimity (upeksa) and formulates the vow of bringing them to renounce any feeling of fondness (anunaya) or aversion (pratigha) For other explanations of these four immeasurable feelings, see what has been said above (p 1239-1273F) 3 Sutra - Tyagaparikarma danadayakapratigrahakanupalabdhitam upadaya // yad bodhisattvah sarvasattvebhyo vikalpitam danam dadati // <2388> The generosity of not apprehending either gift or giver - The bodhisattva makes gifts to all beings free of discrimination Sastra (p 411c28) - Generosity (tyaga) is of two kinds: i) Making a gift by giving up a material object (amisa); ii) obtaining bodhi by giving up the fetters (samyojana) The former is ’abandoning’ insofar as it rejects avarice (matsrya); by contrast, the latter, the abandoning’ of the fetters, plays the role of cause and condition (hetupratyaya) It is necessary to reach the seventh ground in order to abandon the fetters Question - There are several kinds of abandoning: internal (adhyatmika) or external (bahya) gift, small (laghu) or large (guru) gift, material gift (amisadana) or gift of the Dharma, worldly gift (laukikadana) or supraworldly gift (lokottaradana), etc Why then does the Buddha speak only of supraworldly gift free of discrimination’ (avikalpita) and free of conceptualization (asamkalpita)? Answer - Although generosity is of any type, the Buddha speaks only of great generosity, the generosity that does not grasp the characteristics (nimittodgrahanahita)342 Furthermore, the Buddha subscribes to no dharma and therefore teaches the bodhisattva a generosity without adherence’ (nirasanga), in conformity with the teachings of the Buddhas Here it would be necessary to speak at length about the generosity free of discrimination (avikalpitadana); as for the other kinds of generosity, they have been the object of many explanations already in several places 4 Sutra - Kalyanamitrasevanaparikarma nairmanyatam upadaya // yani kalyanamitrani sarvajnatayam samadapayanti tesam mitranam sevana bhajana paryupasana susrusa / The good services rendered to good friends by not deriving any pride from them - Helping, venerating, respecting and listening to good friends who encourage one to omniscience 342 Triply pure generosity (trimanḍalaparisuddha) where there is total absence of giver, gift and recipient: cf p 675- 677F, 724F 1983Sastra - (p 412a4) - On the good services rendered to good friends, see the explanations given above (Pancavimsati, p 156) <2389> 5 Sutra - Dharmaparyestiparikarma sarvadharmanuplabdhitam upadaya // yad bodhisattvah sarvajnatapratisamyuktais cittotpadair dharmam paryesate na ca sravakapratyekabuddhabhumau patati / The search for the Dharma by means of the non-apprehension of all the teachings - The bodhisattva seeks the Dharma with resolutions associated with omniscience and [hence] does not fall to the rank of sravaka or pratyekabuddha Sastra (p 412a5) - There are three kinds of Dharma: 1) The supreme Dharma of all (sarvesv anuttara), ie, nirvana 2) The means of attaining nirvana (nirvanapraptyupaya), ie, the noble eightfold Path (aryastangamarga) 3) All good words (subhasita), truthful words (satyavacana) promoting the eightfold noble Path These are: (a) the eighty-four thousand articles of the Dharma (caturasitidharmaskandha-sahasra), or (b) the twelve- membered speech of the Buddha (dvadasangabuddhavacana), or (c) the four Baskets (catuspitaka) consisting of (i) the [four] Agamas (agamacatuspitaka), (ii) the Abhidharma, (iii) the Vinaya, (iv) the Ksudrakapitaka, plus all the Mahayanasutras such as he Mahaprajnaparamita, etc All that is called Dharma343 To seek the Dharma (dharmaparyesti) is to write it, to recite it, to study it and to meditate on it These texts heal the mental illnesses (cittavyadhi) of beings The bodhisattva sacrifices his life to gather together these text-remedies Thus while still a bodhisattva, the Buddha Sa was called Lo-fa (Dharmarata) At that time there was no buddha, and this bodhisattva had not yet heard a good word (subhasita), but he was searching everywhere for the Dharma and did not relax his exertion (virya); however, he had not yet found it One day, Mara transformed himself into a brahamana and said to him: I have a stanza (gatha) spoken by a buddha; I will give it to you if you agree to write it using your skin as parchment, your bone as pen and your blood as ink Dharmarata thought: During my previous lifetimes I have lost my life an incalculable number of times without ever deriving any benefit from it Immediately he flayed his skin, put it out to dry and wrote the stanza on it <2390> Mara went to take his life when, at that moment, the Buddha, aware of the extreme resolve of the bodhisattva, arose from the direction of the nadir (adhodis) and came to teach him the 343 This brief summary shows that the Traite did indeed use the Sanskrit canon of the Sarvastivadins as canonical scripture, reserving a separate place for the minor scriptures designated here by the name Tsa-tsang in Chinese, Ksudrapitaka in Sanskrit or, quite simply, Ksudraka: cf p 341F, n 1 1984profound Dharma Immediately Dharmarata obtained the conviction that dharmas do not arise (anutpattikadharmaksanti)344 Sa-t’o-po-louen (Sadaprarudita) also sought the Dharma by ascetic practices (duskara-carya)345 The bodhisattva Sakyamuni drove five hundred nails into his body in order to find the Dharma346 The king Kin-kien (Kancanasara) perforated his body in five hundred places, [put wicks in the holes] and threw himself into the flames in order to light them347 All these heroes were seeking the Dharma by means of these ascetic practices and deeds in order to teach beings Finally, the Buddha himself says here that by seeking the Dharma [with resolutions associated] with omniscience, the bodhisattva does not fall to the rank of sravaka or of prateykabuddha 6 Sutra - Abhiksnanaiskramyaparikarma grhanupalabdhitam upadaya // yad bodhisattvah sarvajatisv avyakirnacittena niskramati / tathagatasasane pravrajati / na casya kascid antarayo bhavati / The continual departure from the world by the non-apprehension of the householder life - From lifetime to lifetime and with an unmixed intent, the bodhisattva goes forth from the world and becomes a monk in the Tathagata’s order, and is not hindered by anyone <2391> Sastra (p 412a25) - The bodhisattva knows that the householder life (grhavasa) is the cause and condition (hetupratyaya) of many wrongs (apatti) If I remain at home, he says to himself, I myself will be unable to carry out the pure practices (visuddhacarya); how then could I lead others to practice them? If I follow the rules of the householder life, I would have a whip and a stick, etc, and I would be tormenting beings If I act in conformity with the Holy Dharma, I will violate the rules of the householder life I have two things 344 Jataka of Dharmarata already mentioned above, p 975F, n 1; 1853F, n 4 - References to Kotanese and Uigur sources in M J Dresden, The Jatakastava, 21st story, p 432 and 339 - Mural painting at Qyzil, in E Waldschmidt, Über die Darstellungen, p 15, and table 1, fig 1 345 Wishing to honor the Prajnaparamita and offer gifts to the bodhisattva Dharmodgata, Sadaprarudita sold his body to Sakra disguised as a young man The sale being concluded, he took a sharp knife, pierced his right arm and let the blood flow; then he pierced his right breast, cut off the flesh and, to break his bones, ran into a wall Cf Astasahasrika, ed U Wogihara, p 947 346 Jataka of king P’i-leng-kie-li (Bhrngara?) who drove a thousand nails into his body in order to hear from the mouth of the brahmana Raudraksa the Buddhist stanza: anitya bata samskarah Cf P’ou-sa-pen-hing king, T 155, k 3, p 119b15-16; Hien-yu king, T 202, k 1, p 350a-b; King liu yi siang, T 2121, k 25, p 136c20-137a3 347 Jataka of Kancanasara told above, p 688F, b 4 - References to the Khotanese, Uigur and Sogdian sources in M J Dresden, The Jatakastava, 43rd story, p 440 and 451 Friezes from Qyzil in E Waldschmidt, Über die Darstellungen,p 16 and 17, fig 25 to 31 1985to think about: if I do not leave home today, I will, of course, be forced to leave it at the time of death; if I abandon it by myself today, my merit (punya) will be great348 Again the bodhisattva has the following thought: Kings and noblemen, powerful as gods, seek happiness and do not find it; death takes them away cruelly As for myself, I am abandoning home for beings in order to keep the pure morality (visuddhasila) [of the monastic], seek the abhisambodhi of the Buddhas and fulfill the causes and conditions for the perfection of morality (silaparamita) Here the Buddha himself says that from lifetime to lifetime and with an unmixed intention, the bodhisattva goes forth from home With an unmixed intention (avyavakirna-cittena), for the bodhisattva does not leave home to embrace the ninety-six kinds of [heretical] doctrines, but only to enter into the Tathagata’s order (tathagatasasane pravrajitum) Why? Because in the Tathagata’s order, both kinds of correct seeing (samyagdrsti) are present: correct worldly (laukika) view and correct supraworldly (lokottara) view349 7 Sutra - Buddhakayasprhaparikarma laksananuvyanjananupalabdhitam upadaya // yad bodhisattvo buddhavigraham drstva na kadacid buddhamanasikarena virahito bhavati yavad anuttaram samyaksambodhim anuprapnoti / Taking delight in the Buddha’s body by the non-apprehension of the major and minor marks - Having seen the body of the Buddha, the bodhisattva never ceases thinking about the Buddha until he attains supreme complete enlightenment Sastra (p 412b8) - The Buddha hears the qualities (guna) of the Buddha praised in many ways: the ten powers (bala), <2392> the four fearlessnesses (vaisaradya), great loving kindness (mahamaitri), great compassion (mahakaruna) and omniscience (sarvajnana) Moreover, he sees the Buddha’s body adorned with the thirty-two major marks (laksana) and the eighty minor marks (anuvyanjana), emitting a great brilliance (mahaprabha) and unceasingly honored by gods and men, and he says to himself: In a future lifetime, I too will be like that Even if he does not fulfill the causes and conditions required to meet a Buddha, already he is delighted in him, and if he does fulfill them, he is even more pleased Possessing the high disposition (adhyasaya), he takes delight in the Buddha, and this is why he always succeeds in meeting a Buddha from lifetime to lifetime 8 Sutra - Dharmavivaranaparikarma dharmabhedanupalabdhitam upadaya // yad bodhisattvah sammukhibhutasya tathagatasya parinirvrtasya va sattvebhyo dharmam desayaty adau kalyanam madhye 348 By contrast with the householder life, the religious life has numerous advantages which have been detailed above, p 839-843F 349 See Majjhima, III, p 72 1986kalyanam paryavasane kalyanam svartham suvyanjanam parisuddham paripurnam yaduta sutram yavad upadesah / The propagation of the Dharma by the non-apprehension of the subdivision of this Dharma - Whether a Tathagata is still present in the world or has already become parinirvanized, the bodhisattva preaches the Dharma to beings, the Dharma which is good at the beginning, good in the middle and good at the end, of good meaning and letter, completely pure and perfectly full, namely, the sutras, etc up to the Upadesas Sastra (p 412b13) - Having sought the Dharma as has been said above, the bodhisattva preaches it to beings (sattvebhyo desayati) The lay bodhisattva (grhastha) practices material generosity particularly; the monastic (pravrajita) bodhisattva, in his love and respect for the Buddha, always practices the generosity of the Dharma (dharmadana) Whether a Buddha is present in the world or not, the bodhisattva <2393> is well established in morality (sila) without seeking fame (sloka) or profit (labha) Equalizing his mind toward all beings, he preaches the Dharma to them (dharmam desayati) This Dharma is good at the beginning (adau kalyana) because it praises generosity; it is good in the middle (madhye kalyana) because it praises morality (sila) in detail; it is good at the end (paryavasane kalyana) for, in reward for these two things [- generosity and morality -], the bodhisattva is going to be reborn in a buddha-field (buddhaksetra) or become a deity Or again, the Dharma is good at the beginning because in seeing the five aggregates of attachment (pancopadanaskandha) of the triple world (traidhatuka) abounding in suffering, one feels disgust (nirvedacitta) towards them It is good in the middle because one abandons lay life and separates oneself from the world It is good at the end because the mind is liberated from the disturbing emotions (klesa) Or finally, the Dharma is good at the beginning because it first explains the Vehicle of the sravakas It is good in the middle because it explains [next] the Vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas It is good at the end because it [finally] proclaims the Greater Vehicle The Dharma is good in meaning and good in letter (svartha suvyanjana) In the threefold speech, the elocution may be good while the reasoning is mediocre and superficial, or the reasoning may be profound and good while the elocution in imperfect; this is why the sutra says here that the meaning is good and the letter is good The Dharma is completely pure (parisuddha) because, having eliminated the stains of the triple poison, it enunciates only the True Dharma (saddharma), without mixing in false dharma (adharma) The Dharma is completely clear (paripurna) because the noble eightfold Path (arya astangikamarga) and the six perfections (satparamita) are complete in it On the twelve-membered [speech of the Buddha] (dvadasangabuddhavacana), sutra, etc, see what has been said above (p 2286-2303F) 19879 Sutra - Manastambhanirghatanaparikarma, adbhutatanupalabdhitam upadaya // yad bodhisattvas tena manastambhanirghatanena na jatu nicakulesupapadyate / The destruction of pride and vanity by the non-apprehension of any superiority whatsoever - By the destruction of pride and vanity, the bodhisattva is never reborn into lowly families <2394> Sastra (p 412b29) - The bodhisattva goes forth from home (pravrajati), observes morality (silam raksati), preaches the Dharma (dharmam desayati) and cuts the doubts of beings (sattvanam samsayams chinatti); and sometimes he becomes puffed up and experiences pride (mana) and vanity (stambha) In that case, he should make the following reflection: I have shaved my head, I have put on the yellow robe (kasaya) and with bowl in hand, I beg for my food This is of the nature of destroying pride and vanity in me How could I feel pride and vanity in that? Moreover, pride and vanity dwell in the human mind These faults stifle the qualities, they are detested by men and are the source of a bad reputation In later lifetimes, the prideful are always reborn among wild animals or, if they are reborn among humans, they are base and lowly in condition Knowing that pride and vanity have these immense defects, the bodhisattva destroys this pride and this vanity in order to seek supreme complete enlightenment If the person who begs for material things should be humble and modest, then what should be said about the person who is seeking the peerless bodhi? Because he has destroyed pride and vanity, the bodhisattva is always reborn among the nobility and never in lowly families 10 Sutra - Satyavacanaparikarma vacananupalabdhitam upadaya // tatra katamad bodhisattvasya satyavacanaparikarma / bhagavan aha / yaduta bodhisattvasya yathavadita tathakarita / imani bodhisattvena mahasattvena prathamayam bhumau vartamanena dasaparikarmani karaniyani // Truthful speech by means of non-apprehension of any speech - What is truthful speech in the bodhisattva? - The Bhagavat replied: It is the fact that the bodhisattva acts as he says These are the ten preparations for accomplishment by the bodhisattva-mahasattva in the first ground Sastra (p 412c9) - Truthful speech is the root of all good (kusala), the cause and condition of rebirth among the gods; it is believed and accepted by all people He who puts it into practice does not pretend generosity (dana), morality (sila) or wisdom; merely by cultivating truthful speech, he wins immense merit (punya) Truthful speech is acting as one says Question - There are four [good] vocal actions (vakkarman): [abstaining from lying (mrsavada), from malicious gossip (paisunyavada), from harmful speech (parusyavada) and from idle speech (sambhinnapralapa)350]; why does the sutra not mention truthful speech here? 350 See p 771F 1988Answer - In the Buddhadharma, truth (satya) is specially honored; this is why the sutra here speaks of the truth that encompasses (samgrhnati) the four [good] vocal actions One obtains nirvana by means of the truth Furthermore, the bodhisattva who relates to beings will [inevitably] endure harmful words (parusyavada), idle words (sambhinnapralapa) and malicious gossip (paisunyavada); sometimes he will even commit the grave wrongdoing of false speech (mrsavada) himself He must correct this in the first ground On the first ground, the bodhisattva is not yet able to practice the four [good] vocal actions fully; this is why the sutra mentions only truthful speech [here]; in the second ground, he will be able to practice it fully Question - Why is it a matter of only the ten preparations (dasaparikarma) in the first ground? Answer - The Buddha is the king of Dharma, having mastery (vasita) over all dharmas He knows that these ten preparations can produce the first ground He is like a good physician (vaidya) who knows the number of medicines (bhaisajya) necessary to cure the sickness, sometimes five, sometimes ten Therefore there is no objection that can be raised against the number [of preparations] Bhumi II 1 Sutra - Punar aparam subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvena dvitiyayam bhumau vartamanenastau dharma abhiksnam manasikartavyah / katame stau / yaduta silaparisuddhih /tatra katama bodhisattvasya silaparisuddhih / yaduta bodhisattvasya mahasattvasya sravakapratyekabuddhacittanam amanasikarah / ye pi tadanye dauhsilyakara bodhiparipanthakara dharmas tesam amanisikarah / iyam bodhisattvasya silaparisuddhih / Moreover, O Subhuti, the bodhisattva-mahasattva on the second ground must think about eight dharmas continually What are these eight? 1) Purity of morality In the bodhisattva, what is the purity of morality? - The bodhisattva-mahasattva does not think about the concepts of the sravakas or the pratyekabuddhas <2396> nor does he think about other doctrines, immoral teachings that are an obstacle to bodhi Sastra (p 413c10) - In the first ground, the bodhisattva mainly practiced generosity (dana); now he knows that morality is superior to generosity Why? Morality takes in all beings whereas generosity does not include all of them The domain of morality is immense (aprameya): this is how the morality consisting of not killing living beings (pranatipataprativirati) grants life to all beings Beings are innumerable and infinite, and the merit [consisting of sparing them] is itself immense and infinite Here the sutra briefly mentions (samksepena) the teachings that create an obstacle to bodhi (bodhiparipanthakara): these are immoral’ doctrines (dauhsilyakara) A teaching must be free of any immorality to be called pure (parisuddha) If the concepts of the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas already [in 1989some respects] constitute a stain on morality (silamala),351 what can be said then (kah punarvadah) of these other doctrines, overtly bad? 2 Sutra - Krtajnata krtavedita // yad bodhisattvo mahasattvo bodhisattvacaryam carann alpam api krtam asamsaran na nasayati prag eva bahu / Acknowledgement and gratitude - The bodhisattva-mahasattva traveling on the bodhisattva career does not, until the end of samsara, forget any favor even if it is small, or, all the more so if it is big Sastra (p 413c17) - Some people say: It is because of merits won in my previous existences (purvanivasapunya) that I have obtained such a benefit Others say [to their benefactor]: I am personally deserving: what benefit have you done for me? To speak thus is to fall into wrong views (mithyadrsti) And so the Buddha says here that the bodhisattva must acknowledge kindnesses (krtajna) Although beings in their previous existences may have acquired the rights to happiness (sukhahetu), they would be unable to enjoy this happiness if, in their present existence, certain circumstances [such as the generosity of a benefactor] did not occur Thus the seeds (bija) of the grain are in the earth, but without rain <2397> (vrsti) they cannot sprout It cannot be said that the rain is of no use on the pretext that the earth produces the grain Although the benefits we gather at present have been planted [by us] during earlier lifetimes, why would the fondness and kind feelings of our benefactors not play a part in these benefits? Moreover, acknowledgement (krtajnata) is the source of great compassion (mahakarunamula) and opens the first door to good actions (kusalakarman) The grateful person is loved and esteemed by people; his renown extends afar; after his death, he is reborn among the gods and finally he will attain abhisambodhi In this regard, the Buddha has told the story of the following Jataka: 351 This is not a criticism Sthavira Buddhism is in perfect agreement with natural morality (sila) amd religious discipline (samvara) However, it does not attain the perfection of morality (silaparamita) advocated by the Mahayana which depends essentially on the non-existence of sin and its opposite (apattyanapattyanadhyapattitam upadaya): cf p 770F, 861F 1990[Ṛksajataka]352 - A man went to the mountains in order to cut <2340> wood He lost his way in a violent 352 Ṛksa- or Ṛksapatijataka, making up part of the stock of jatakas situated at Benares in which king Brahmadatta always appears Like so many other fables, it contrasts the kindness of animals with the ingratitude of humans The story has been amply illustrated in the Buddhist art and literature of both Vehicles Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya, Samghabhedavastu, ed R Gnoli, II, p 104-106 (= T 1450, k 15, p 177a26-c18): bhutapurvam bhiksavo varanasyam nagaryam anyatamo daridrapurusah prativasati; sa kasthani vikriya jivikam  tadapy esa akrtajna akrtavedi; etarhy apy esa akrtajnah akrtavedi Transl: Once, O monks, a poor man was living in the city of Benares; he earned his living by selling wood One day, having risen very early, he took his curved axe and went to the forest in search of wood Unexpectedly a great cloud arose accompanied by showers and wind The man who, rightly or wrongly, was trying to find another spot and went from one tree to another, but the rain got heavier and he finally took shelter in a cave in the mountain There was a bear in this cave; seeing it, the man was frightened and wanted to flee The bear said to him: My child, why are you afraid? You have nothing to fear from me; stay Although hesitant, the man was so worried that he could not leave Then the bear took him up in its arms, carried him into the cave and fed him with roots and fruits The storm lasted seven days without stopping Seven days passed and on the eighth, the sky cleared and the cloud disappeared The bear, having looked at the sky in the four directions of the horizon, brought the man abundant roots and fruits and said to him: My child, the storm has passed, the sky is clear and the clouds have disappeared Go in peace! The man fell to his feet and said to the bear: Father, I am leaving but I must do you a favor in return The bear answered: My child, the only thing you must do for me is not to betray me to anyone The man answered: Father, so be it He circumambulated the bear, prostrated at its feet and went away The man entered Benares as a certain hunter was going out to hunt This hunter saw him and said: Friend, here you are back again after a long time; your son and your wife are upset; they are crying because they think you have certainly been the victim of the seven-day storm or of a wild animal Animals and birds in great numbers have perished in the storm How did you escape? The man told him everything that had happened and the hunter said: Friend, show me the cave where this bear is The man answered: Friend, never will I go back into the forest, no matter how my life was saved But the man was so beguiled by the hunter who promised him two-thirds of the meat that he finally agreed and went with the hunter to show him the way <2399> Gradually they reached the cave where the kind bear was and then, following his cruelty and ingratitude, he declared: Here is the cave where the bear is At once the hunter, whose way of life it is to take the life of others, set fire to the cave The kind bear, its mind disturbed by the smoke and its eyes clouded by tears, spoke this verse: From whom did I take anything while I lived in this cave in the mountain, eating fruits, roots and water, wishing for others’ benefit? Now at the moment of death, what should I do? But corporeal beings must submit [to the fruits] of actions, whether these fruits are desirable or not Having spoken these words, the bear died Then the two friends cut up the animal and shared the meat The hunter said to the ungrateful man: Take two-thirds of the meat The man stretched out his hands to grab it; they fell to the ground Then the hunter cried: O misfortune! and abandoning even the share that belonged to him, went away Having heard about this great wonder, a great crowd gathered there; the king Brahmadatta, curious, went to that place Somewhere on the mountain there was a monastery His eyes wide open in amazement, the king took the bear’s skin and went to the monastery to tell the community of monks about the affair He set the skin at a pool of blue 1991rainstorm and at sunset, he was hungry and cold Poisonous insects and animals came to attack him and so he entered a cave in the rock In this cave there was a big bear (rksa); seeing it, the man wanted to run out in fear The bear said to him: Don’t be afraid; this cave is warm, you can spend the night here The rain lotuses, sat down among the elders and told them the full story The abbot of this community was an arhat He spoke to the king thus: This was not a bear, O great king, but it was the bodhisattva Dyutimdharma He should be honored by the three worlds and by you too, O best of men The king acknowledged that it was necessary to pay homage to him The bhiksus said: Lord, this is a bodhisattva of the fortunate age; his worship should be organized Then Brahmadatta accompanied by his wives, princes, ministers and inhabitants of the city took all kinds of scented wood to the place of the miracle Having piled up the flesh and bones of the bear, the king said: Sirs, build a funeral pyre of all kinds of scented wood and set it on fire with great respect A great stupa was erected at this place; parasols, standards and banners were placed on it; a lamp was set in place and those by whom these works had been accomplished were promised deliverance What do you think, O monks? I was that bear at that time and at that era; the ungrateful man was Devadatta at that time and that epoch Then he was an ungrateful man not acknowledging kindnesses; even now he is an ungrateful man not acknowledging kindnesses Mahavibhasa, T q1545, k 114, p 592b3-29 Almost the same story but with two hunters in place of one Kosabhasaya, ed P Pradhan, p 270, l 11-12: rsyamrgajatakadyudaharanat taking as examples of ingratitude the Jatakas of the antelope (rsya) and the deer (mrga): but the reading is erroneous: rsya should be corrected to rksa bear’ as shown by the Chinese and Tibetan translations of the Kosa: hiong lou teng pen cheng (T 1558, k 18, p 96b21) and dom dan ri dags sogs pahi skyes pa (Tib Trip Vo 115, no 5591, fol 260a7) The reading rksa appears elsewhere in the Kosavyakhya, ed U Wogihara, p 434, l 23: rksamrdajatakadi Las brgya tham pa, Tib Trip, Vol 39, no 1007, summarized by L Feer, Le Karmasataka, in JA Taken from nos Jan-Feb, Mar-Apr, May-June, 1901, p 51-52 Kalpanamanḍitika, T 201, k 13, p 332b11-12: When I was incarnated as a bear, <2340> I took pity on a man in danger When the man whom I had saved betrayed my den to hunters, I was free of anger (transl by E Huber, Asvaghosa Sutralamkara, 1908, p 383) Lalitavistara, ed S Lefmann,p 168, l 15-18 (= T 187, k 5, p 566c1-2) Transl - When, O lord, you were a bear in a den in the mountains, you gathered up a man fearing the snow-storm, you served him fruits and roots with great goodwill When he soon afterwards brought the hunter to you, that also you endured Rastrapalapariprccha, ed L Finot, p 25, l 15-16 (= T 310, k 80, p 462b23-24): When I was a princely bear, a man caught in a snow-storm was sheltered by me for seven days in an inaccessible cave When he brought a murderer to me, I made no resistance to him See also J Ensink, The Question of Rastrapala, 1952, p 26 Khotanese source in M J Dresden, The Jatakastava, 36th story, p 438 and 451: Under the snow’s covering in winter, the man was like to die; was like to die by hunger also You, as the bear, just as a father cares for his son, cared for him in your arms, precious as your life This ungrateful, ignoble, avaricious man for greed spoke of you in the presence of huntsmen Therefore they destroyed you and parceled out your flesh For the ingratitude, at once his hands fell upon the ground Representations: Ajanta (cf A Foucher, Lettre d’Ajanta, JA, 1921, I, p 216): Central Asia (cf E Waldschmidt, Über die Darstellungen, p 53 and 54, fig 164-167) 1992lasted for seven days The bear constantly offered the man sweet fruits, excellent water and provided him with fresh supplies After seven days the rain stopped The bear guided the man, showed him the path and said to him: I have been a sinner and have many enemies If anybody asks you, don’t tell them that you have seen me The man agreed But following on his path, this man saw some hunters (lubdhaka) One of the hunters asked him: Where do you come from; have you seen any game? The man answered: I saw a big bear but <2401> this bear has done me favors; I cannot show him to you The hunter said: You are a human and, among humans, we must help one another Why spare this bear? You have lost your way once; when will you get back home? If you show me the bear, I will give you the biggest share [of the meat] The man changed his mind, guided the hunter and showed him where the bear lived The hunter killed the bear and offered him the biggest portion But just when the man stretched out his hands to receive the meat (mamsa), his two arms fell to the earth The hunter asked him: What wrong-doing have you committed? The man answered: This bear treated me like a father treats his son; it is for not being grateful for his kind deeds that I suffer this punishment Frightened, the hunter did not dare to eat the flesh of the bear and went to offer it to the saagha The abbot (samghasthavira), an arhat possessing the six superknowledges (abhijna) said to the monks: This bear was a bodhisattva; in his future existence he will obtain abhisambodhi Do not eat this meat Then the monks built a stupa and paid homage to the bear Hearing about this business, the king proclaimed an edict in his kingdom forbidding ungrateful people from living there any longer There are many reasons to praise grateful people They are esteemed in all Jambudvipa and people place their trust in them Moreover, the bodhisattva has the following thought: Even if a man does me harm, I should save him; all the more reason I should save those who have done me a favor 3 Sutra - Ksantibalapratisthanam // yad bodhisattvasya sarvasattvanam antike vyapada-vihimsacittata / Basing oneself on the power of patience - The bodhisattva has no thought of malice or harm towards beings Sastra (p 414a19) - See our lengthy explanation on the perfection of patience (ksantiparamita) (p 865- 926F) Question - Patience appears in many aspects (prakara); why is the sutra limited here to presenting it as non-malice and non-harming (avyapadavihimsa)? Answer - Because [the absence of malice and harm] is the very essence of patience [An injured person] first produces a thought of malice and then harms someone by voice <2402> or body (purvam vyapadacittam utpadayati, pascat kayena ca vaca va paran vihimsati) Here, since it is a matter of a bodhisattva at the beginning of his career (adikarmika), the sutra speaks only of patience towards beings (sattvaksanti) but does not speak of patience towards things 1993 4 Sutra - Pramodyaprityanubhavanata // yad bodhisattvasya sarvasattvaparipacanatayam pramodanata / Feeling joy and contentment - The bodhisattva feels joy in ripening all beings Sastra (p 414a23) - The bodhisattva sees that his body (kaya) and voice (vac) have been purified by the observance of morality (sila) and that his mind (manas) has been purified by his feelings of gratitude (prajnata) and patience (ksanti) Since the three kinds of action, [physical, vocal and mental (kayavanmanaskarman)] are pure (parisuddha) in him, he experiences joy and contentment (pramodyapritim anubhavati) A man bathed in perfumed water, clothed in new garments and adorned with necklaces, when he looks in the mirror (adarsa), feels joy and contentment In the same way also, the bodhisattva is very pleased at having obtained this good dharma (kusaladharma) of morality He says to himself: Morality is the root of concentration (samadhi) and wisdom (prajna) Immense and infinite qualities will be easy to obtain by me who has just acquired this pure morality, This is why he rejoices The bodhisattva established in this morality and this patience ripens (paripacayati) beings so that they are able to be reborn in the presence of the Buddhas of other regions or enjoy happiness among gods and men Sometimes he even makes them obtain the Vehicles of the sravakas, pratyekabuddhas and the Buddhas He considers the attachment of beings as happiness and, just as an adult, seeing little children amusing themselves together plays with them first, then gives them other playthings to make them renounce their previous toys, so the bodhisattva disciplines beings by first making them obtain human and divine happiness, then leads them gradually to discover the three Vehicles This is why the sutra says here that he experiences joy and contentment 5 Sutra - Sarvasattvaparityagita // yad bodhisattvasya sarvasattvanam paritranata / <2403> Do not abandon anyone - The bodhisattva saves all beings Sastra (p 414b6) - The bodhisattva who has cultivated well the mind of great compassion (mahakarunacitta) has sworn to save beings and his resolve is strong So as not to suffer the scorn of the Buddhas and aryas, so as not to forget his obligations to beings, he does not abandon them The man who has promised something to someone and who then does not give it is guilty of deception For these reasons the bodhisattva does not abandon beings 6 Sutra - Mahakarunaya amukhibhavah // yad bodhisattvasyaivam bhavati / ekaikasya sattvasyaham ganganadivalukopaman kalpan niraye pacanany anubhaveyam yavan na sa sattvo buddhajnane pratisthapito bhaved nirvanadhigato va bhavet / evam yavat sarvesam dasadiksattvanam krte ya utsaho yam ucyate mahakarunaya amukhibhavah / 1994The entry into great compassion - The bodhisattva has the following thought: May I, for each being, for periods as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, suffer in hell all the torments, as long as this being will not be established in the knowledge of the Buddhas or will not enter into nirvana If the bodhisattva extends such an effort to all beings of the ten directions, that is his entry into great compassion Sastra (p 414b10) - On great compassion (mahakaruna), see what has been said above (p 1705- 1717F) As the Buddha says here, from the beginning, the bodhisattva makes the following resolve concerning beings: For such and such a person in particular, for innumerable periods, I will suffer in his place the torments of hell and I will pursue my effort until I have led him to accumulate the qualities (guna), to become Buddha or to enter into nirvana without residue of conditioning (nirupadhisesanirvana) Question - But there is no way of suffering a punishment in place of another;353 why then does the bodhisattva make such a vow (pranidhana)? Answer - [Without a doubt], but this bodhisattva has such strong resolve and loves beings so deeply that if he had the means of substituting himself for the guilty ones, he would do so without hesitation Moreover, the bodhisattva sees that, among people, there are sacrifices to the gods (devayajna) where human flesh is used, human blood <2404> and the five human internal organs are offered to the raksasas but where substitutions of people are authorized Then the bodhisattva says: In the hells there must be substitutions of this kind and I am determined to take the place of others there Learning that the bodhisattva’s great resolve is like that, beings honor him (gurukurvanti) and respect him (satkurvanti) Why? Because the bodhisattva’s concern for beings is so profound that it surpasses even that of a loving mother 7 Sutra - Gurusraddhagauravasusrusa // yad bodhisattvasya gurunam antike sastrsamjna / Faith, respect and submissiveness to the teachers - The bodhisattva produces the notion of teacher (ie, he considers his teachers as being the Buddha in person) towards teachers Sastra (p 414b21) - Because of his teachers, the bodhisattva obtains supreme complete enlightenment: why then would he not believe them, respect them, honor them? High as his own knowledge (jnana) and qualities (guna) may be, the bodhisattva would not derive great benefit from them if he lacked respect and veneration for his teachers The excellent water at the bottom of a well (udapana) cannot be reached without a rope (rajju); in the same way, destroying his pride (mana) and vanity (stambhacitta), the bodhisattva must be respectful and obedient [towards his teachers] so that the great benefits (mahartha) resulting from his virtues (guna) may come to him The rain (vrsti) that falls does not stay at the top of the mountain (giryagra), but necessarily flows downward; in the same way, if the bodhisattva is prideful and haughty [towards his teachers], the water of the Dharma (dharmodaka) does not enter into him But if he respects good teachers, the qualities due to him fall on him 353 Because the fruits of action are strictly personal and not communicable: see above, p 2312F, n 1 1995Finally, the Buddha has said that it is necessary to depend on good teachers so that morality (sila), concentration (samadhi), wisdom (prajna) and deliverance (vimukti) can increase (vrddhi); in the same way that the trees (vrksa) that grow on the Himalayas, their roots, trunk, branches, leaves, flowers and fruits are in full bloom This is why the Buddha said that we must honor our teachers as if they were the Buddha in person Question - But if it is a matter of bad teachers, how could one serve them and trust them? It is impossible to regard good teachers as the Buddha and all the more difficult to regard bad teachers as the Buddha <2405> Then why does the Buddha here want us to produce the idea of the Bhagavat toward teachers (gurunam antike sastrsamjna)? Answer -The bodhisattva should not conform to worldly judgments (lokadharma) Those who conform to them are attached to the good and turn away from the bad The bodhisattva does not act in that way If some teachers are able to explain to him the profound meaning (gambhirartha) and cut the knot of his doubts (samsayasamdhi), he sees his benefit (hita) there, he honors them wholeheartedly and does not think about their defects If a bad purse (bhastrika) is full of jewels (ratna), one does not refuse to take the jewels under the pretext that the purse is bad; if you are traveling at night on a steep path and some thieves offer you a torch (ulka), you would not refuse this light under the pretext that the thieves are bad In the same way, the bodhisattva who finds the light of wisdom (prajnaprabha) in his teachers does not care about their faults Furthermore, the disciple should say to himself; My teacher uses the innumerable artifices (apramanopaya) of the Prajnaparamita; I do not know why he affects this fault Thus Sa-t’o-po-louen (Sadaprarudita) heard the voice of the Buddhas of the ten directions say to him from heaven: Do not think about the deficiencies of the Dharma teacher (dharmabhanaka); always have respect and fear for him354 Finally, the bodhisattva has the following thought: That the Dharma teacher likes what is bad is not my business; what I desire is only to hear the Dharma and derive benefit from it A clay or wooden statue, without any real qualities, makes one gain immense merit only by evoking the idea of buddha (buddhasamjna); what then should be said about this man capable of preaching the Dharma to people with the skillful means of wisdom (prajnopaya)? Consequently, although the Dharma teacher may have faults, that is not very important Towards teachers, the bodhisattva produces the idea of bhagavat (bhagavatsamjna) As I have said above, the bodhisattva is different from worldly people Worldly people make distinctions between beauty and ugliness; they like honest people but do not see them <2406> as buddhas; they distrust bad people and 354 Astasahasrika, ed U Wogihara, p 929-930: Atha khalu Sadapraridito bodhisattvah punar api sabdam asrausit  Imas tvaya kulaputranusamsah paritulayamanena dharmabhanake bhiksau sastrsamjnotpadayitavya na ca tvaya kulaputra lokamisapratisamyuktaya cittasamtatya dharmabhanako bhiksur anubaddhavyah / dharmarthikena ca tvaya dharmagauravena dharmabhanako bhiksur anubaddhavyah / Transl - Then the bodhisattva Sadaprarudita heard this voice: O son of good family, weighing these advantages, you should produce the idea of Teacher in regard to all bhiksus preaching the Dharma A bhiksu preaching the Dharma should not be followed by you for reasons of material order but out of interest and respect for the Dharma 1996do not take them into account The bodhisattva himself is not like that: he contemplates the absolute emptiness (atyantasunyata) of dharmas which from the very beginning (mulata eva) are like nirvana without residue of conditioning (nirupadhisesanirvana); he looks at all beings and sees them as equal to the Buddha All the more reason that he sees as equal to the Buddha the Dharma teachers (dharmabhanaka) who possess the advantages of wisdom (prajna) and who do the work of Buddha (buddhakarya) 8 Sutra - Paramitasudyogaparyestih // yad bodhisattvasyaikacittena paramitanam paryesanatananyakarmataya ime subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvena dvitiyayam bhumau vartamanenastau dharmah paripurayitavayah / The energetic search for the perfections - The bodhisattva seeks the perfections attentively, without doing anything else These are the eight dharmas to be fulfilled by the bodhisattva-mahasattva who is in the second ground Sastra (p 414c24) - The bodhisattva has the following thought: The six perfections are cause and condition for supreme complete enlightenment (anuttara samyaksambodhi) I will cultivate this cause and condition attentively (ekacittena) Merchants (vanij) who diligently search for the goods asked for by the lands through which they travel, farmers (karsaka) who diligently look for the seeds (bija) needed for the soil which they are cultivating, cannot fail to succeed in their business The person who, in the present lifetime, practices generosity (dana), later obtains great wealth; the person who keeps the discipline (sila) later obtains noble [rebirths]; the person who practices concentration (samadhi) and wisdom (prajna) obtains bodhi It is the same for the bodhisattva: if he practices the six perfections (paramita), he succeeds in beoming buddha It is a matter here of energetic search (udyogaparyesti), ie, of constant attentive and energetic search for the six perfections Why? Because if slackness (slaksnacitta) creeps in, one is stifled by the passions (klesa) and overcome by Mara This is why the Buddha says here in the second ground not to relax energetic search (udyogaparyesti) <2407> Bhumi III 1 Sutra - Punar aparam subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvena trtiyam bhumau vartamanena pancasu dharmesu sthatavyam / katamesu pancasu / yaduta bahusrutye trtpatayam // tatra karama bodhisattvasya mahasattvasya bahusrutye trptata / yat kimcid buddhair bhagavadbhir bhasitam ihalokadhatau samantad dasasu diksu lokadhatusu tat sarvam adharayisyamiti yatrptata / iyam bodhisattvasya bahusrutye trptata / Furthermore, O Subhuti, the bodhisattva-mahasattva in the third bhumi should devote himself to five dharmas What are these five? 19971) An insatiable desire for learning What is this instiable desire for learning in the bodhisattva-mahasattva? - The insatiable desire that makes him say: I will remember everything that has been said by the blessed Buddhas in this universe and everywhere in the universes of the ten directions; this is the insatiable desire for learning in the bodhisattva Sastra (p 415a5) - The bodhisattva knows that learning (bahusrutya) is the cause and condition for wisdom (prajna) and that, possessing this wisdom, he will be able to follow the path (marga) with discernment Endowed with vision (caksusmat), this person travels without any obstacles This is why the bodhisattva makes the wish to remember completely (antasas) all the teachings preached by the Buddhas of the ten directions He remembers everything by the power of the srutadharadharani, the dharani of retaining what has been heard’, by the power of the very pure divine eye (parisuddha-divyasrotra) and by the power of the asampramosadharani the dharani of not forgetting’ Just as the great sea collects and retains all the waters flowing from the ten directions, so the bodhisattva collects and retains all the teachings preached by the Buddhas of the ten directions 2 Sutra - Niramisadharmadanavivaranatayam taya camanyanataya // yad bodhisattvas tena dharmadanenanuttaram samyaksambodhim api na pratikanksati prag evanyartham / Choosing the selfless gift of Dharma by preference without deriving any pride - By way of this gift of Dharma, the bodhisattva does not even wish for supreme perfect enlightenment or any other thing for that matter Sastra (p 415a11) - Some bad weeds grow among the grain, but if one eliminates the rye grass, the grain flourishes This is what the bodhisattva does: practicing the gift of the Dharma [in preference] <2408> over all the others, he desires neither fame (yasas) nor gain (labdha) nor fruit of maturation (vipakaphala) in future lives; in the interest of others, he goes even so far as not to seek the nirvana of the Lesser Vehicle (hinayanika nirvana); he limits himself in his great compassion (mahakaruna) for beings to turning the wheel of the Dharma (dharmacakrapravartana) following the Buddhas: this is the specific characteristic of generosity of the Dharma 3 Sutra - Buddhaksetraparisodhanatayam taya camanyanataya // sarvakusalamulanam buddhaksetraparisodhanaya parinamana / The purification of the buddha-fields, without deriving pride from it - Using all the roots of good for the purification of the buddha-fields 1998 4 Sutra - Aparimitasamsaraduhkhanubhavaparikhedanatayam taya camanyanataya // evamvidhaih kusalamulair upastabdho yaih sattvams ca paripacayati buddhaksetram ca parisodhayati bodhisattva na khedam apadyate yavan na sarvajnatam paripurayati / Sastra (p 415a15) - For the words buddhaksetraparisodhanata, aparimitasamsara-duhkhanubhavanata, hryapatrapyasthanata [appearing in items 3, 4 and 5 of bhumi III], aranya-vasaparityagita, alpecchata and samtusti [appearing in items 1, 2 and 3 of bhumi IV], see what has been said above Question - There are many reasons why the bodhisattva does not tire (na khedam apadyate) of dwelling in samsara; why then does the sutra mention only two, [namely, his desires to ripen beings (sattvaparipacana) and to purify his buddha-field (buddhaksetra-parisodhana)]? Answer - When the bodhisattva dependent on his roots of good (kusalamulair upasthabdhah) dwells in samsara, his sufferings and torments are diminished (tanubhuta); he is like a wounded man (vranin) who has been given a good medicine (bhaisajya) and whose sufferings are thus decreased notably The bodhisattva has acquired roots of good so pure (parisuddha) that the sadness (daurmansaya), jealousies (irsya), malicious thoughts (dustacitta) of the present existence are eliminated for him <2409> When he assumes a new existence (atmabhavam adadati), he gathers the fruits of retribution (vipakaphala) of his roots of good, he himself enjoys happiness, works in many ways for the benefit (hita) of beings and purifies his own buddha-field (buddhaksetram parisodhayati) as he wishes (yatheccham) The splendor of the [Buddha] universes surpasses that of the divine palaces (devavimana); one never tires of contemplating them They soothe the minds of the great bodhisattvas and, even more so, those of worldly people This is why even though the bodhisattva has many reasons [for remaining in samsara], the sutra mentions only these two here 5 Sutra - Hryapatrapyasthanatayam taya camanyanataya // ya sarvasravakapratyeka- buddhacittajugupsanata / esu subhute pancadharmesu bodhisattvena mahasattvena trtiyayam bhumau vartamanena sthatavyam // Settling into shame, but without deriving any pride from it - The repulsion [that the bodhisattva should feel] for the state of mind of the sravaka and the pratyekabuddha The bodhisattva-mahasattva in the third ground, O Subhuti, should hold to these five dharmas Sastra (p 415a25) - There are several types of shame (hryapatrapya):355 here it is a matter of repulsion (jugupsanata) for the state of mind of the sravaka and prateykabuddha The bodhisattva has made the resolution to save all beings in general If, [like the sravakas] he accepted only a little suffering or, [like the 355 The meaning of hri and apatrapya, two mental events of broad meaning (mahabhumika) are discussed in Kosa, II, p 170-173 1999pratyekabuddhas], he wanted to go alone to nirvana, this would be shameful on his part If, after having prepared a feast and invited a crowd of people, a man was seized by an attack of miserliness (matsarya) and started to eat alone, that would be shameful Bhumi IV 1 Sutra -

Bypassing the stage of all the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas is not renouncing the stay in the forest Sastra (p 415a29) - Staying in the forest (aranyavasa) is staying away from crowds and dwelling alone For the bodhisattva, bypassing the sravaka and pratyekabuddha stage is staying away from crowds 2 Sutra - Alpecchata // yad bodhisattvo nuttaram samyaksambodhim api necchati prag evanyartham / Little desire - The bodhisattva does not even desire supreme complete enlightenment and, still less, any other thing Sastra (p 415b2) - By virture of the emptiness consisting of the non-apprehension of dharmas (sarvadharmanam anupalabhasunyata),356 the bodhisattva does not seize any characteristic marks (na nimittany udgrhnati) and does not become attached to them It is the same up to anuttara samyaksambodhi: he practices detachment of mind (nihsangacitta) 3 Sutra - Samtustih // yah sarvakarajnatayah pratilambhah / Satsifaction - The acquiring of the knowledge of all the aspects 356 The fifteenth emptiness, p 2145F 2000Sastra (p 415b4) - The bodhisattva who always accumulates the qualities (guna) without ever getting tired is satisfied (samtusta) when he has attained supreme enlightenment (anuttara bodhi), for there is no dharma superior to it357 As for satisfaction (samtusti) in regard to food, clothing, beds, seats (pinḍapatavivara-sayanasana), etc, it is a cause and condition of good dharmas, but, as it does not consider it to be important, the sutra does not speak of it here 4 Sutra - Dhutagunanutsarjanata // ya gambhiresu dharmesu nidhyanaksantih / <2411> Not neglecting the ascetic rules - Patience in meditating on the profound teachings Sastra (p 415b7) - In a following chapter, the Kiue-mo p’in (Maravabodhaparivarta),358 we will speak about the acquiescence that dharmas do not arise (anutapattikadharmaksanti) In the present passage, the sutra, by dhuta, means this anutpattikadharmaksanti During the course of the preparatory convictions (anulomiki ksanti),359 the bodhisattva contemplates the anutpattikadharmaksanti The twelve dhutas produce purity of morality (silaparisuddhi), purity of morality produces concentration (samadhi), and concentration produces wisdom (prajna) But true wisdom is anutpattikadharmaksanti Therefore anutpattikadharmaksanti is the fruit of maturation (vipakaphala) of the dhutas [Actually, here the sutra metaphorically is designating the effect by the cause (karye karanopacarat)360 5 Sutra - Siksaya aparityagita // yah sarvasiksanam apracarah / The non-abandoning of the moral dictates - This is the non-observance of all the moral regulations Sastra (p 415b12) - The bodhisattva who understands the true nature of dharmas (dharmanam dharmata) sees neither morality (sila) nor immorality (dauhsilya)361 Although, for many reasons he does not violate 357 Only arrival at abhisambodhi is fully satisfying to the bodhisattva The sravaka, on the other hand, is content with modest material advantages: Samyutta, II, p 208; Anguttara, II, p 27 358 Chapter of the Pancavimsati entitled Kieu-mo p’in in T 221, k 10, p 72c-74b; Mo-che p’in (Marakarmaparivarta) in T 223, k 13, p 318b-320b - Compare the Marakarmaparivarta of the Astasahasrika, ed U Wogihara, p 771-784 359 Acquiescences favoring the seeing of the noble truths (cf Divya, p 80, l 1: satyanulomah ksantayah) and being part of the four roots of good leading to penetration of the truth (kusalamula nirvedhabhagiya): cf Kosa, VI, p 163- 167 360 For the expression karye karanopacarat, see above, p 1932F, n 1 Not neglecting the ascetic rules is not neglecting the anutpattikadharmaksanti resulting from the long-term observation of these rules 361 By means of the Prajnaparamita, the bodhisattva penetrates the true nature of things (dharmanam dharmata), namely, the absence of any nature; by means of the silaparamita, he makes no distinction between wrongdoing (apatti) and its opposite (anapatti): cf p 770F, 861F) In no way does it follow that he violates morality 2001morality, what is important for him is to cross through the gate-of-deliverance called emptiness (sunyatavimoksamukha)362 6 Sutra - Kamagunajugupsanata // yah kamacittasyanutpadah / Disgust for the [five] objects of desire - Not producing even the idea of desire <2412> Sastra (p 415b15) - See above Here the Buddha would say: When one knows that the nature of the mind (cittalaksana) is deceptive and unreal, one no longer produces even the idea of desire (kamacitta) and all the more so, one no longer experiences the [five] objects of desire (kamaguna) 7 Sutra - Lokanirvedacittotpadah // yah sarvadharmanam anabhisamskarah / Sastra (p 415b17) - See what has been said above (p 1457F and following) about the notion of displeasure in regard to the world (sarvaloke nabhiratisamjna) Here the Buddha wants to talk about the fruit of maturation (vipakaphala) resulting from disgust for the wotld (lokanirveda), namely, the gate-of- deliverance called wishlessness (apranihitavimoksasamukha)363 8 Sutra - Sarvastiparityagita // yadyatmikabahyanam dharmanam agrahanata / The rejection of everything exists Not holding either inner dharmas or outer dhrmas364 Sastra (p 45b18) See above (p 2044) 9 Sutra - Anavalinacittata // yad dvividhasu vijnanasthitisu bodhisattvasya cittam na tisthati / The mind without dullness - The bodhisattva’s mind does not remain on duality levels of consciousness Sastra (p 415b19) - We have already spoken about this above several times The bodhisattva is informed about the nature of this non-slackening (anavalinata) and this absence of fear (abhaya) and does not remain (pou tchou, na tisthati) on twofold levels of cosciousness (vijnanasthiti) On these twofold planes of consciousness, in the sense that he does not produce <2413> visual consciousness (caksurvijnana) in regard to the eye (caksus) and visibles (rupa), and so on up to: in regard to the mind (manas) and dharmas, he does not produce mental consciousness (manovijnana) The bodhisattva remains (tisthati) in the non- duality (advayamukha) [of subject and object] Determining that the objects (jneya) of the six consciousnesses (saḍvijnana) are false and deceptive, he makes the great vow to lead beings to remain in non-duality and to become separated from the six consciousnesses 362 See p 1216F 363 See p 1219F 364 Already in the canonical sources, the expression sarvam asti concerns the twelve ayatanas, six inner and six outer: Samyutta, IV, p 15 The first three emptinesses (cf p 2044F) counteract them 2002 10 Sutra - Sarvavastvanapeksata // ya sarvavastunam amanasikarata // ime subhute dasadharma bodhisattvena mahasattvena caturthyam bhumau vartamanena na parityaktavyah / Disdain for everything - The bodhisattva does not think about anything These ten dharmas must not be abandonded by the bodhisattva-mahasattva in the fourth ground Sastra (p 415b24) - There are many reasons for this disdain for everything, but here the main one is that the bodhisattva, knowing the absolute emptiness (atyantasunyata)365 of all dharmas, no longer thinks about these dharmas and eliminates any grasping at characteristics (sarvanimittograhana) This is why he does not expect any gratitude (krtajnata) from those who are indebted to him (pratigrahaka) and does not feel any pride (mana) in his own generosity In this way he completely fulfills the pure perfection of generosity (parisuddha danaparamita) Bhumi V 1 Sutra - Punar aparam subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvena pancamyam bhumau vartamanena dvadasadharmah parivarjayitavyah / katame dvadasa / grhisamstavah parivarjayitavyah // tatra katama bodhisatvasya grhisamstavaparivarjanata / yaduta bodhisattvasya pravrajitanmesu buddhaksetrad buddhaksetram samkramanatabhiksnanihkramanata mundata kasayavastrapravaranata / iyam bodhisattvasya grhisamstavaparivarjanata / Furthermore, O Subhuti, the bodhisattva-mahasattva in the fifth bhumi must avoid twelve dharmas What are these twelve? 1) Avoiding the company of lay people In his monastic existences, the bodhisattva passes from buddha-field to buddha-field, each time goes forth from home, shaves his head and puts on the ochre robe: this is his way of avoiding the company of lay people <2414> Sastra (p 415b29) - In order to embtrace the path (marga), the yogin goes forth from home (pravrajati) If he continued to keep company with lay people (grhin), nothing would be changed in his former way of life; this is why the yogin first seeks to save himself and then to save others If he wanted to save others before saving himself, he would be like the man who, not knowing how to swim, wants to save a drowning person; he would be swept away along with the drowning person By avoiding being with lay perople, the bodhisattva is able to accumulate the pure qualities (parisuddhaguna) Recollecting the Buddha intensely, he transforms his body, goes into the buddha-fields, 365 The ninth emptiness: p 2085F 2003leaves home, shaves his head and puts on the yellow robe (kasayvastra) Why? Because he always takes pleasure in the monastic condition and abhors meeting with lay people 2 Sutra - Bhiksunisamstavah parivarjayitavyah // yad bhiksunya sardham acchatasamghatamatram api na tisthati na ca tannidanam paritarsanacittam utpadayati / Avoiding the company of nuns - The bodhisattva does not stay near a nun even for as little time as a fingersnap, and he does not bemoan the fact Sastra (p 415c6) - See the first chapter Question - The bodhisattva considers all beings with equanimity (samacittata); why does he not stay [near a nun]? Answer - This bodhisattva is not yet non-regressing (avaivartika) and has not yet destroyed all the impurities (ksinasrava), but he has already accumulated qualities (guna) and is loved by men This is why he does not stay near women Besides, he wants to avoid being slandered, for whoever slanders him would fall into hell366 3 Sutra - Parakulamatsaryam parivarjayitavyam // iha bodhisattvenaivam cittam utpadayitavyam / yan maya sattvanam sukhopadhanam kartavyam tad ete sattva mam tasmai sukhopadhanayopakurvanti natra maya matsaryacittam utpadayitavyam / Avoiding being envious of others’ families - The bodhisattva should make the following reflection: I must make others happy and if those people help me in making this happiness, I do not have to feel jealous <2415> Sastra (p 415c11) - The bodhisattva makes the following reflection: I have left my own family (kula) without greed or regret; why would I have greed and envy towards the families of others? It is a rule for the bodhisattvas to lead all beings to find happiness; why feel greed and envy for them? Because of merits (punya) from their previous lives, these beings are enjoying some comfort in the present lifetime and thus are making offerings to me; why would I be jealous of them and envy them? 4 Sutra - Samganikasthanam parivarjayitavyam // yatra sravakapratyekabuddha bhaveyus tatpratisamyukta va cittotpada utpadyeran tatra bodhisattavena na sthatavyam / Avoiding meeting places - The bodhisattva should not go to meeting places where there are sravakas or pratyekabuddhas and where comments would be made about them Sastra (p 415c15) - These useless conversations are idle speech (sambhinnapralapa) intended to dissipate sadness (soka) in one’s own mind and in that of others They tell stories about palaces or thieves, they 366 Thus Kokalika fell into hell for having slandered Sariputra and Maudgalyayana: cf p 806-813F 2004speak about the sea or the mountains, trees, plants, jewels, foreign kingdoms or other similar things These conversations are of no use to merits (punya), of no use to bodhi The bodhisattva has pity for beings who have fallen into the fire of impermanence (anityata): I want to save them, he says How would I sit calmly chatting idly about useless things? In the case of a fire, people rush about; how would I remain inwardly calm holding forth on something else? Here the Buddha is saying that talking about things concerning the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas is already a uselss conversation; what then could be said of talking about something [even more useless]? 5 Sutra - Vyapadah parivarjayitavyah // yad vyapadacittasya vihimsacittasya vigrahacittasya vavakasam na dadati / Avoiding maliciousness - He does not give free rein to the mind of malice, to the mind of harmfulness, to the mind of hostility Sastra (p 415c23) - In the mind there first arises a feeling of maliciousness (vyapada) which is as yet vague (aniyata) The maliciousness increases, becomes specific, and then one strikes with a stick (danḍa) or an axe <2416> (kuthara): this is a feeling of harmfulness (vihimsacitta) Insult (parusyavada) and gossip (paisunyavada) are feelings of quarrelsomeness (kalahacitta) Killing, torture, the stick and fetters come from a feeling of hostility (vigrahacitta) In his great loving-kindness (mahamaitri) and great compassion (mahakaruna) for beings, the bodhisattva does not experience these feelings; he always curbs these bad thoughts and prevents them from having access (avakasa) 7 Sutra - Parapamsanam parivarjayitavyam // yaduta bahyanam dharmanam asamanupasyanata / Avoiding exaltation of the self - Not taking extreme dharmas into consideration Sastra (p 415c27) - The bodhisattva sees neither inner nor outer dharmas, namely the five aggregates (pancaskandha) assumed (upatta) to be me’ and the five aggregates not assumed (anupatta) to be me’ 8 Sutra - Dasakusalakarmapathah parivarjayitvyah // tatha hy ete dasakusalakarmapatha aryasyastangikasya margasyantarayakarah prag evanuttarayah samyaksambodheh / Avoiding the ten bad paths of action - Actually, these ten bad paths of action are an obstacle to the noble eightfold path and even more so more to supreme complete enlightenment Sastra (p 415c29) - In these ten bad paths of action, the bodhisattva sees multiple causes and conditions of wrong-doings (apatti), as has been said above In the present passage, the Buddha makes it known that the ten bad paths of actions already destroy the Lesser Vehicle (hinayana) and all the more so the Greater Vehicle (mahayana) <2417> 2005 9 Sutra - Adhimanah parivarjayitavyah // tatha hi bodhisattvo na kamcid dharmam samanupasyati kutah punar adhikam yenadhimanyeta / Avoiding great pride - Actually the bodhisattva does not see any dharma and still less a superior dharma in which he could take pride Sastra (p 416a2) - The bodhisattva who cultivates the eighteen emptinesses (sunyata) does not see a definite mark of big or small in any dharma 10 Sutra - Stambhah parivarjayitavyah // tatha hi bodhisattvas tad vastu na samanupasyati yatrasya stambha utpadyeta / Avoiding arrogance - Actually the bodhisattva does not see anything on which arrogance could arise Sastra (p 416a3) - For the bodhisattva has eradicated the roots of the sevenfold pride (saptavidhamana)367 and loves good dharmas deeply 11 Sutra - Viparyasah parivarjayitavyah // vipayasavastunam anupalabdhitam upadaya / Avoiding mistakes - By means of the non-apprehendoing of mistakes368 Sastra (p 416a4) - Because in all dharmas there is nothing that is eternal (nitya), happy (sukha), pure (suci), personal (atman) 12 Sutra - Ragadvesamohah parivarjayitavyah / tatha hi ragadvesamohanam vastu na samanupasyati // ime subhute dvadasadharma bodhisattvena mahasattvena pancamyam bhumau vartamanena parivarjayitavyah / Avoiding desire, hatred and delusion - Actually, he sees nothing that could be the object of desire, hatred or delusion These are, O Subhuti, the twelve dharmas to be avoided by the bodhisattva-mahasattva in the fifth ground <2418> Sastra (p 416a5) - On the meaning of the triple poison (visatraya), see what has been said above Moreover, the objects (alambana) of the three poisons have no fixed nature (niyatalaksana) 367 The seven minds of pride (mana) and listed or defined in Samyutta, T 99, k 7, p 49a10-11; Ekottara, T 125, k 38, p 760a29 (whereas the Anguttara, III, p 430 lists six); Vibhanga, p 383; Kosa, V, p 26-27’ Kosabhasya, p 284-285 368 The four objects of error (viparyasa) are the body, feeling, the mind and dharmas (cf p 1150F) Not grasping them is to eliminate belief in the individual (satkayadrsti) by this means 2006Bhumi VI Sutra - Punar aparam subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvena sasthyam bhumau vartamanena saḍ dharmah paripurayitavyah / katame sat / yaduta sat paramitah paripurayitavah // tatha hy asu satsu paramitasu sthitva buddha bhagavantah sravakapratyekabuddhas ca paramgatah / Apare saḍ dharmah parivarjayitavyah / yad uta 1) sravakaprateykabuddhacittam parivarjayitavyam // yad bodhisattvasyaivam bhavati / yad sravakapratyekabuddhacittam naisa margo nuttarayai samyaksambodhaye / 2) dane paritarsanacittam parivarjayitavyam // tata tasyaivam bhavati / naisa margo nittarayai samyaksambodhaye / 3) yacanakam drstva navalinacittam utpadayitavyam // tat tasyaivam bhavati naisa margo nuttarai samyaksambodhaye / 4) sarvavastuni parityajyani // bodhisattvena prathamacittotpadam upadaya danam dadata tad deyam tan na deyam iti na vaktavyam / 5) sarvavastuni parityajya na daurmanasyacittam utpadayitavyam // maitrikarunabalam upadaya/ 6) na gambhiresu dharmesu vicikitsacittam utpadayotavyam // sraddhagunabalam upadaya / ime subhute saḍ dharma bodhisattvena mahasattvena sasthyam bhumau vartamanena paripurayayitavyah / apare saḍ dharmah parivarjayitavyah / Furthermore, O Subhuti, the bodhisattva-mahasattva in the sixth ground should completely fufill six dharmas What are these six? They are the six perfections - Indeed, it is by keeping these six perfections that the blessed Buddha, the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas have reached the other shore Six other dharmas are to be avoided, namely: 1) The bodhisattva should avoid thinking like the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas - The bodhisattva says to himself that the way of thinking of the sravaka and the pratyekabuddha is not the path that leads to supreme complete enlightenment 2) By giving, he must avoid any sadness - He says to himself that actually this is not the path that leads to supreme complete enlightenment 3) Seeing a beggar, he must avoid any discouragement - He actually says that this is not the path that leads to supreme complete enlightenment <2419> 4) He must abandon all his possessions [without distinction] - Practicing generosity since his first production of the mind of bodhi, the bodhisattva should not say: This may be given away; that may not be given away 5) After having given away all his possessions, he must not feel any regret He does this by the power of his loving-kindness and compassion 20076) He must not have any doubt about the profound teachings - This due to the quality of his faith These, O Subhuti, are the six dharmas which the bodhisattva-mahasattva must fulfill when he is on the sixth ground, and the other six dharmas that he should avoid Sastra (p 416a6) - For the six perfedtions (paramita), see above (chapters XVII-XXX) Here the Buddha specifies the six perfections by which the adepts of the three Vehicles all reach othe other shore (para)369 Question - But the present chapter deals with the grounds of the bodhisattva; why then does it speak of the sravaka and pratyekabuddha attaining the other shore? Answer - Here the Buddha is speaking of the great power held by the six perfections The Mahayana in its system contains the whole Hinyana, but the Hinayana does not contain the whole Mahayana Here the bodhisattva in the sixth ground completely fulfills (paripurayati) the six perfections He sees the emptiness of all dharmas (sarvadharmasunyata), but, as he does not yet have the power of skillful means (upayabala), he risks falling back into the rank of sravaka and pratyekabuddha And so the Buddha, to protect him, orders him here to avoid the manner of thinking of the sravakas and pratyhekabuddhas This bodhisattva thinks about beings profoundly, feels great compassion for them (mahakarunacitta) and understands the absolute emptiness (atyantasunyata)370 of all dharmas When he gives, he saves nothing; when he sees a beggar, he has neither anger (krodha) nor sadness (daurmanasya); after having given, he feels no regret Since his merits are great, the power of his faith (sraddhabala) <2420> is great as well In his profound pure faith, he venerates all the Buddhas and completely fulfills (paripurayati) the six perfections Although he has not yet acquired [skill] in means (upayakausalya), or the conviction that dharmas do not arise (anutpattikadharmaksanti), or the concentration [of the visualization of the Buddhas] of the present (pratyutpannasamadhi), he feels no doubt (vicikitsa) about the profound Dharma (gambhiradharma)371 He makes the following reflection: All teachings (upadesa) have faults (dosa); only the wisdom of the Buddhas (buddhaprajna) destroys the futile proliferation (prapanca) and has no lapses (vaikalya) And so, thanks to skillful means (upaya), he cultivates the good dharmas (kusaladharma) and this is why he does not doubt 369 The Satasasrika, p 1465, l 14-17 is more detailed: Tatha hy asu satsu paramitasu sthitva buddha bhagavantah sravakapratyekabuddhas ca pancavidhasya jneyarnavasya parangata gacchanti gamisyanti ca / katamasya pancavidhasya / yadutatitasyanagatasya pratyutpannasyavaktavyasyasamskrtasya / Actually, by keeping these six perfections, the blessed Buddha, the sravakas and the pratyekabuddhas attain and will attain the other shore of the fivefold ocean of the knowable, namely, the past, the future the present, the unspeakable and the unconditioned This is the pancavidham jneyam, five categories of things capable of being known: cf Kosa, IX, p 237; Kosabhasya, p 463, l 1 370 Ninth emptiness, p 2085F 371 Upayakausalya and complete anutpattikadharmaksanti are acquired in the seventh and eighth grounds repectively The bodhisattva of the sixth ground does not yet possess them, but he uses the prajnaparamita by virtue of which he has no doubts about the profound teachings related to emptiness 2008 Bhumi VII Sutra - Punr aparam subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvena saptamyam bhumau vartamanena vimsatidharma na kartavyah / 1) atmagraho na kartavyah // tatha hy atyantatayatma na samvidyate / 2) sattvagraho na kartavyah / 3) jivagraho na kartavyah / 4) pudgalagraho yavaj jnanipasyakagraho na kartavyah // tatha hy ete dharma atyantataya na samvidyante / 5) ucchedagraho na kartavyah // tatha hi na kascid dharma ucchidyate tvantatayanutpannatvat sarvadharmanam / 6) sasvatagraho na kartavyah // tatha hi yo dharmo notpadyate sa na sasvato bhavati/ 7) nimittasamjna na kartavya // tatha hy atyantataya samkleso na sam viyate / 8) hetudrstir na kartavya / tatha hi sa tam drstim na samanupsyati / 9) namarupabhiniveso na kartavyah / tatha hi namarupam vastulaksanena na samvidyate / 10) pancaskandhabhiniveso na kartavyah / 11) astadasadhatvabhiniveso na kartavyah / 12) dvadasayatanabhiniveso na kartavyah // tatha ho te dharmah svabhavena na samvidyante / 13) traidhatuke bhiniveso na kartavyah // 14) tradhatuke pratisthanam na kartavyam / 15) traidhatuke dhyavasanam na kartavyam / 16) traidhatuka alayo na kartavyah // tatha hi sarvadharmah svabhavena na samvidyante / 17) buddhanisrayadrstyabhiniveso na kartavyah // tatha hi na buddhadrsitinisrayad buddhadharsanam utpadyate / 18) dharmanisrayadrstyabhiniveso na kartavyah // dharmasyadrstatvat / 19) samghanisrayadrstyabhiniveso na kartavyah // samghanimittasyasamskrtatvad anisrayatvac ca / 20) silanisrayadrstyabhimiveso na karftavyah // apattyanapattitam anabhinivesat / ime vimsatidharma na kartavyah / Moreover, O Subhuti, the bodhisattva-mahasattva in the seventh ground must avoid twenty things 1) Avoid belief in a self - Actually, the self does not exist at all 20092) Avoid belief in existence 3) Avoid belief in the living being 4) Avoid belief in the individual, etc, on the subject of who is knowing, who is seeing - Actually, these dharmas do not exist at all 5) Avoid belief in extinction - Actually, no dharma is extinguished since all dharmas are absolutely unborn 6) Avoid belief in anything eternal - Actually, a dharma that is unborn is not eternal 7) Reject the notion of characteristic mark - Actually, purification [like defilement] does not exist at all 8) Reject the view of causes - Actually, the bodhisattva does not consider this view to be correct 9) Not to be attached to name and form - Actually, name and form do not really exist 10) Not to be attached to the five aggregates 11) Not to be attached to the eighteen elements 12) Not to be attached to the twelve bases of consciousness - Actually, these dharmas do not exist as inherent nature 13) Not to be attached to the triple world 14) Not to take it as a foundation 15) Not to take it as a term 16) Not to take it as a home - Actually, dharmas do not exist as inherent nature 17) Not to be attached to the view of resorting to the Buddha - Actually, the [true] seeing of the Buddha does not come from this view <2422> 18) Not to be attached to the view of resorting to the Dharma - For the Dharma is invisible 19) Not to be attached to the view of resorting to the samgha - For the samgha is unconditioned in itself and does not constitute a support 20) Not to be attached to the view of resorting to [high] disciplines - For the bodhisattva is not attached to [distinguishing arbitrarily] between guilt and innocence These are the twenty things to be avoided Sastra (p 417a25) - There are twenty things, the atman, etc, to which the bodhisattva is not attached (nabhinivisate) because they do not exist The reasons they do not exist have been explained above in many ways The views (drsti) about the atman, the subject that knows and the subject that sees (numbers 1 to 4), as well as the views about the Buddha and the samgha (numbers 17 and 19) are derived from the emptiness of 2010beings (sattvasunyata) and cannot be accepted All the others, from the view of extinction and of eternity (numbers 5 and 6) up to the view about the disciplines (number 20) cannot be accepted because of the emptiness of phenomena (dharmasunyata)372 Question - The other views are well-known, but what is the view of causes (number 8)? Answer - All conditiond dharmas (samskrtadharma) are cause (hetu) and fruit (phala) in turn But the mind, being attached to these dharmas and grasping at their characteristics (nimittodgrahana), gives rise to the wrong view here called view of causes’ (hetudrsti); thus for example, one speaks of fruit without cause, or one claims that cause and fruit are identical, different, etc373 1 Sutra - Tena vimsatir eva dharmah paripurayitavyah / katame vimsatir / yad uta Sunyataparipurita // svalaksanasunyataparipurih / This bodhisattva [of the seventh ground] must completely fulfill <2423> twenty things What are they? Completely fulfilling emptiness - This is completely fulfilling the emptiness of specific characteristics Sastra (p 417b2) - The bodhisattva who practices the eighteen emptinesses completely completely fulfills emptiness (sunyatam paripurayati) Moreover, practicing the two kinds of emptiness, the emptiness of beings (sattvasunyata) and the emptiness of phenomena (dharmasunyata), is to completely fulfill emptiness Finally, the bodhisattva who practices the absolute emptiness (atyantasunyata)374 but is not attached to it (nabhinivisate) completely fulfills emptiness Question - If that is so, why does the Buddha not speak about the emptiness of specific characteristics (svalaksanasunyata) here?375 Answer - Because the three kinds of emptiness of which we have just spoken are the emptiness of specific characteristics When he was in the sixth ground, thanks to his merits (punya), the bodhisattva had keen faculties (tiksnendriya) and, by means of these keen faculties, he still distinguished dharmas and grasped their characteristics: that is why, now that he is in the seventh ground, the emptiness of specific characteristics constitutes for him the fullness of emptiness (sunyataparipuri) 372 Items 17 to 20 are a subtle ciriticism against the noble disciple inspired by faith in regard to the Buddha, the Dharma and the Samgha and endowed with disciplines dear to the saints (aryasravako buddhe dharme samghe vetyaprasadena samanvagatah, aryakantaih silaih samanvaghatah); Samyutta,IV, p 272-273; V, p 364; Anguttara, IV, p 406-407; V, p 183; Avadanasataka, II, p 92, l 6-8; Kosa, VI, p 292-294 - The avetyaprasada is defined in Kosabhasya, p 387, l 9: yathabhutam satyany avabudhya sampratyayah, the faith following upon correct understanding of the truths 373 The problem of causality has been fully discussed above, p 2170-81F 374 Ninth emptiness, p 2085F 375 Thirteenth emptiness, p 2121F 2011Sometimes the bodhisattva sets out the emptiness of the conditioned (samskarasunyata) and the emptiness of the unconditioned (asamskrtasunyata) as being the fullness of emptiness; sometimes he propounds the emptiness consisting of non-perception (anupalambhasunyata) as being the fullness of enmptiness 2 Sutra - Animittasaksatkriya // yaduta sarvanimittanam amanasikarah / Attesting to signlessness That is to say, not thinking about any mark Sastra (p 417b11) - Signlessness (animitta) is nirvana It can be vouched for (saksatkrta), but it cannot be meditated on (bhavita) Since it cannot be meditated on, one cannot pretend to know it; since it is immense (aprameya), infinite (ananta) and unimaginable, one cannot claim to fulfill it completely 3 Sutra - Apranihitajnanam // yat traidhatuke cittam na pravartate / <2424> Knowing what does not deserve to be thought about - The fact that the bodhisattva’s mind does not function in regard to the triple world Sastra (p 417b13) - The three things [sunyata, animitta and apranihita], although they are penetrations, are knowledges (jnana); but here the sutra brings up a modification for the first two and, [in place of calling them knowledges (jnana)], calls them [fullness’ (paripurita) and attestation’ (saksatkara) respectively] Here apranihita is the only one to be called knowledge’ (jnana) Above (p 1216-1232F) I spoke about the three gates of deliverance (vimoksamukha); I will not repeat it here376 4 Sutra - Trimanḍalaparisuddhih // yaduta dasakusalakarmapathaparisuddhih / Purifying the three groups completely - That is to say, purifying entirely the ten good paths of action Sastra (p 417b15) - The three groups (trimanḍala) are the ten good paths of action (dasakusalakarmapatha); the first three are physical (kayika), the next four are vocal (vacika) and the last three are mental (caitasika) It is a matter of purifying them completely (parisuddhi) In some people, the physical acts are pure and the vocal acts impure; in others, the vocal acts are pure and the physical acts are impure; in others still, the physical and vocal acts are pure and the mental acts impure; in yet others, the three kinds of acts are pure but they have not rejected the prejudices (abhinivesa) about them Here in the bodhisattva [of the seventh ground], the three kinds of action are pure and he has rejected prejudices about them This is why it is said that he has purified the three groups 376 In the Taishß edition, this phrase appears in line 16 of p 417b while it ought to appear in line 15 of the same page 20125 Sutra - Sarvasattvesu krpakarunyaparipaurih // yaduta mahakarunapratilanhah / Completely fulfilling pity and compassion towards beings - And he does this by taking possession of great compassion Sastra (p 417b21) - There are three kinds of compassion (karuna); i) that which has beings as object (sattvalambana), ii) that which has <2425> things as object (dharmalambana), iii) that which has no object (analambana)377 Here it is a matter of great compassion without an object, which is the fulfillment (paripuri) of compassion Since dharmas are empty of inherent nature (svabhavasunyata) and the true nature of things (dharmata) itself is empty, the compassion [of the bodhisattva] is called great compassion without object (analambana mahakaruna) The bodhisattva [of the seventh ground] has deeply penetrated the true nature (dharmata) and then has compassion for beings He is like a man, father of a single son, who, having found a precious object, wants to give it as a gift to his son out of his profound affection 6 Sutra - Sarvasattvamananam // yaduta buddhaksetraparisodhanaparipurya/ Not thinking of any being - And he does this by completely fulfilling his buddha-field Sastra (p 417b27) - Question - If the bodhisattva does not think of beings, how can he purify his buddhafield? Answer - By leading beings to establish themselves in the ten good paths of action (dasakusalakarmapatha), the bodhisattva had already purified his buddhafield, but such an adornment was not yet an obstacle-free (anavarana) adornment Now [in the seventh ground], the bodhisattva ripens (paripacayati) beings but does not grasp the characteristic of being (na sattvanimittam udgrhnati) His roots of good (kusalamula) and his merits (punya) are pure and, because of this purity, he adorns [his buddhafield] without obstacle 7 Sutra - Sarvadharmasamatadarsanam tatra canabhinivesah // yadutanuksepo praksepah sarvadharmanam / Seeing the equality of all dharmas without being attached to it - This is not adding anything to and not taking away anything from dharmas Sastra (p 417c2) - See what has been said above (p 327F) about dharmasamataksanti Here the Buddha himself says that it is not adding anything to (anutksepa) and not subtracting anything (apraksepa) from dharmas <2426> 377 The three kinds of maitri and karuna are a Mahayanist invention: see above, p 1245F, 1250F, n1, and 2372F 20138 Sutra - Sarvadharmabhutanayaprativedhas tena camananta // yah sarvadharmanam bhutanayaprativedhah / Penetrating the true principle of all dharmas, but not thinking about it - This is not penetrating the true principle of all dharmas Sastra (p 417c4) - This has already been fully developed above in many ways 9 Sutra - Anutpadaksantih // ya sarvadharmanam anutpadaya, aniroddhaya, anabhisamskaraya ksantih / Adherence to non-production - This is adherence to non-production, non-destruction, non-formation of all dharmas Sastra (p 417c5) - It is believing and understanding, without hindrance (avarana) or regression (vivartana), the true nature (dharmata) of dharmas, having neither production nor destruction 10 Sutra - Anutpadajnanam // yan namarupanutpadajnanam / Knowing non-production - This is knowing the non-production of name and form Sastra (p 417c6) - The sutra first mentions adherence (ksanti); next it speaks of knowledge (jnana) here Adherence is coarse (audarika) whereas knowledge is subtle (suksma)378 Here the Buddha himself says that is is a question of knowledge about the non-production of name and form (namarupa)379 11 Sutra - Sarvadharmanam ekanayanirdesah // ya cittasya dvayasamudacarata/ Declaring the single dharacteristic of all dharmas - This is because the bodhisattva’s mind does not move into duality Sastra (p 417c8) - The bodhisattva knows that the twelve bases of consciousness (dvadasayatana), both internal (adhyatmika) and external (bahya), are the net of Mara (marajala), deceivers (vancana) and unrealities (abhuta); the six kinds of consciousness (vijnana) arising from these twelve bases are themselves the net of Mara as well and deceivers Then what <2427> is real? Only non-duality (advaya) The absence of the eye (caksus) and visibles (rupa) etc, up to and including the absence of the mind (manas) and phenomena (dharma): that is reality (bhuta) In order to lead beings away from the twelve bases of consciousness, the bodhisattva constantly speaks to them of this non-duality in many ways 12 Sutra - Kalpanasamudghatah // ya sarvadharmanam avikapanata / Destroying the imaginations - This is not conceptualizing any dharma 378 For more detail, see Kosa, VI, p 190 379 Namarupa is a synonym for the five skandhas 2014Sastra (p 417c12) - The bodhisattva established in this non-duality destroys the differentiations [falsely attributed] to objects (alambana): the qualities of male (purusa) or female (stri), long (dirgha) or short (hrasva), big (mahat) or small (alpa), etc 13 Sutra - Samjnavivartah // yapramananam samkalpanam vivartanata / The reversal of notions - This is the reversal of the innumerable false notions Sastra (p 417c14) - Destroying the false conceptualizations (samkalpa) of the inner mind differentiating dharmas 14 Sutra - Drstivivartah // ya sravakabhumeh pratyekabuddhabhumes ca drstivivartanata / The reversal of [false] views - This is the reversal of the views formed at the stage of sravaka and the stage of pratyekabuddha Sastra (p 417c15) - This bodhisattva has first reversed the wrong views (mithyadrsti), such as the view of the self (atmadrsti), the view of the extremes (antagrahadrsti), etc; next, he has entered into the Path (marga) Now, [in the seventh ground], he reverses the view of phenomena (dharmadrsti) and the view of nirvana (nirvanadrsti) [He reverses dharmadrsti] because dharmas have no fixed nature (niyatalaksana); he reverses nirvanadrsti because in reversing the sravaka and pratyekabuddha views he goes directly to the bodhi of the Buddhas (abhisambodhi) 15 Sutra - Klesavivartah // yah sarvaklesayah / Reversing the passions - This is destroying all the passions <2428> Sastra (p 417c18) - By the power of his merit (punya) and his morality (sila), the bodhisattva has first broken up his coarse passions (audarikaklesa) and easily followed the Path (marga); only the subtle passions (suksmaklesa) - affection (anunaya), views (drsti), pride (mana), etc - remain in him Now [in the seventh ground] he also eliminates the subtle passions380 Furthermore, the bodhisattva who uses the true wisdom (bhutaprajna) sees these passions as being the same as the true nature (dharmata)381 He is like a man endowed with the superknowledges (abhijna) who can change impure thngs (asuci) into pure things (suci)382 16 Sutra - Samathavipasyanasamatabhumih // yaduta savakarajnatapratilambhah / 380 See Traite, T 1509, k 39, p 345c27-346a4 381 This theme is fully developed in the Vimalakirtinirdesa, French transl, p 2875-291 382 This is the abhijna of magical powers described above, p 1819-1822F 2015[Attaining] the state of balance between quietude and introspection - This is the [gradual] taking possession of the knowledge of things in all their aspects Sastra (p 417c22) - When the bodhisattva was in the first three grounds, introspection (vipasyana) was predominant over quietude (samatha) because he was not yet able to concentrate his mind (cittasamgrahana); in the following three grounds, quietude was predominant over introspection: this is why he had not had the assurance of attaining bodhisattvahood (bodhisattvaniyama) Now [in the seventh ground], his quietude and introspection in regard to the emptiness of beings (sattvasunyata) and the emptiness of phenomena (dharmasunyata) are perfectly balanced (samata); this is why he can easily (ksema) travel on his career of [great] bodhisattva Starting [from the seventh ground], the level called non-regressing (avaivartikabhumi), he will gradually (kramasas) attain the knowledge of all the aspects (sarvakarajnata)383 <2429> 383 According to the canonical sources, samatha (ting houei in Kumaarajiva), tche kouan in Hiaun-tsang) is derived directly from the teaching of the four noble truths: 1) five dharmas should be completely known (parijneya), the five aggregates of attachment (upadanaskandha); 2) two dharmas should be eliminated (prahatavya), ignorance (avidya) and the thirst for existence (bhavatrsna); 3) two dharmas should be realized (saksatkaratavya), knowledge (vidya) and deliverance (vimukti); 4) two dharemas should be cultivated (bhavayitavya), tranquility (samatha) and introspection (vipasyana) All of these processes result from abhijna or superknowledge (Samyutta, V, p 52) Samatha and vipasyana constitute he fourth truth, the truth of the Path Actually the Path arises in the person who practices them (Anguttara, II, p157) and they lead to the penetration of a multitude of things: anekadhatuprativedha (Majjhima, I, p 494), to the absorption of the cessation of concept and feeling: samjnavedaitanirodhasamapatti (Samyutta, IV, p 295), to nirvana A parable (SamÂutta, IV, p 194-195) compares them to a pair of speedy messengers (sighram dutayugam) communicating the message of truth (yathabhutam vacanam), namely nirvana, to the mind (vijnana) Although samatha and vipasyana are intimately joined, they can be practiced separately or, preferentially, simultaneously (yuganaddham); by following the Path in this way, the fetters (samyojana) are destroyed and the perverse tendencies (anusaya) eliminated (Anguttara, II, p 157) The passage of the Pancavimsati commented on here transposes the entire system into the Mahayanist view The bodhisattva cultivates vipasyana in particular in the first three grounds and samatha in the three following grounds In the seventh, samatha and vipasyana are perfectly balanced, and the bodhisattva penetrates correctly the twofold emptiness of beings and phenomena The goal, the final result, will no longer be nirvana but the knowledge of things in all their aspects (sarvakarajnana) belonging to the fully and completely enlightened Buddhas Tranquility and introspection play a great part in the controversy which, in the 7th century, at the Council of Lhasa or bSam yes, opposed the Chinese Sudden school with the Indian Gradualists Kamalasila’s third Bhavanakrama is dedicated almost entirely to it: cf the edition by G Tucci in Minor BuddhistTexts, Part III, Third Bhavanakrama, Serie Orientale Roma, XLIII, 1971, and the annotated translation by C Pensa, Il terzo Bhavanakrama di Kamalasila, Rivista degli Studi Orentali, XXXIX, 1964, p 211-242 Interest in this question has not yet flagged and we now have an excellent English translation of it from Tson- kha-pa’s Lam rin chen mo (1357-1419) in A Wayman, Calming the Mind and Discerning the Real, 1978 201617 Sutra - Dantacittata // ya traidhatuke nabhiratih / Taming the mind - This is not taking delight in the threefold world Sastra (p 417c26) - Previously the bodhisattva thought about old age (jara), sickness (vyadhi) and death (marana), the three bad destinies (durgati), and it is out of loving-kindness (maitri) and pity (krpa) for beings that he tamed his mind Now that, [on the seventh ground], he knows the true nature (dharmata) of phenomena, he is no longer attached to the threefold world (traidhatukam nabhivisate) and, out of this detachment (anabhinivesa) he tames his mind 18 Sutra - Santacittata // ya sannam indriyanam pratisamharanata / Pacifying the mind - This is withdrawing the six organs Sastra (p 417c29) - Previously, the bodhisattva, in view of nirvana, had only tamed the first five organs (indriya), <2430> namely, the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, by withdrawing them from the five objects of enjoyment (pancakamaguna) - [namely, color, sound, smell, taste and touch] since, at that time [the sixth organ], the organ of mind (mana-indriya), was too hard to tame Now, in the seventh ground, he also pacifies the organ of mind [by withdrawing it from dharmas] 19 Sutra - Apratihatajnanam // yaduta buddhacaksuhpratilambhah / Unobstructed knowledge - This is the attainment of the buddha eye Sastra (p 418a2) - The bodhisattva attains the prajnaparamita and is unobstructed (pratigha) about everything, true or false He acquires the wisdom of the Path (marga) and guides beings to make them enter into the truths He obtains unhindered deliverance (apratihatavimoksa) and possesses the eye of the buddhas (buddhacaksus) He has no obstacles over anything Question - How can the sutra say that the bodhisattva obtains the eye of the buddhas in this seventh ground? Answer - Here one should refer to the buddha-eye (p 2263F): the bodhisattva has no obstacle to any dharma and this is equivalent [to having] the eye of the buddhas 20 Sutra - Aklisto ’nunayah / ya saḍvisayesupeksa / Unafflicted affection - This is indifference in regard to the six sense objects Sastra (p 418a7) - Although in the seventh ground he has obtained the power of wisdom (prajnabala), this bodhisattva still keeps his fleshly body (mamsakaya) out of consideration of his former existences (purvanivasa) Having entered into concentration (samadhi), he is detached (nirasanga); but when he comes out, he has flashes of attachment and, conforming to the visions of his fleshly eye (mamsacaksus), when he sees a beautiful person he loves him tenderly Sometimes also he is attached to wisdom (prajna), 2017to the reality (tattva) of the seventh ground This is why the Buddha tells him here to practice indifference (upeksacitta) in regard to the six sense objects (saḍvisaya) Bhumi VIII 1 Sutra - Punar aparam subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvenastamyam bhumau vartamanena panca dharmah paripurayaitavyah katame <2431> panca yaduta sarvasattvacittanupravesah // yad bodhisattva ekacittena sarvasattvanam cittacaitasikani pratijanati / Furthermore, O Subhuti, the bodhisattva-mahasattva in the eighth bhumi must completely fulfill five dharmas What are these five? 1) Penetrating the minds of all beings - In a single moment of mind, the bodhisattva reveals the minds and mental events of all beings Sastra (p 418a12) - The bodhisattva in the eighth ground reveals the ways of mind of all beings: he reveals the agitated, reflective or profound minds By this knowledge, he distinguishes the beings who will never fulfill the causes and conditions for finding salvation (trana); those who will be saved after innumerable incalculable periods (asamkhyeyakalpa); those who will be saved after one, two and up to ten kalpas; those who will be saved after one or two lifetimes or even in the course of the present lifetime; those who will be saved at this very instant; those who are ripe for salvation (paripakva) and those who are not; those who will be saved by the Vehicle of the sravakas or those who will be saved by that of the pratyekabuddhas The bodhisattva is like a good physician (vaidya) who, on examining the sick person, knows whether his cure is far off or near at hand, or if he incurable 2 Sutra - Abhijnavikriḍanata // yabhir abhijnabhir vikriḍan buddhaksetrad buddhaksetram samkramati buddhadarsanaya / na casya buddhaksetrasamjna bhavati / Playing with the superknowledges - Playing with these superknowledges, the bodhisattva passes from buddha-field to buddha-field to see the buddhas, but he has no notion of buddha-field Sastra (p 418a26) - Previously, the bodhisattva already possessed the superknowledges (abhijna), but now that he plays supremely with them, he can go to immense and infinite universes (lokadhatu) When the bodhisattva was in the seventh ground, sometimes he wanted to attain nirvana Now, for several reasons and because the Buddhas of the ten directions escort him and protect him, he changes his mind and wants to save beings Skillful in the superknowledges, he goes at will (yatheccham) and spontaneously (svatas) to immense and infinite universes without encountering any obstacles He sees <2432> the buddha-fields, but he does not grasp the mark of buddha-field (buddhaksetranimittam nodgrhnati) 2018 3 Sutra - Buddhaksetradarsanata // yad ekasminn eva buddhaksetre sthitvaparimanani buddhaksetrani pasyati / na casya buddhaksetrasamjna bhavati / Seeing the buddha-fields -Staying in his own buddha-field, the bodhisattva sees the immense buddha- fields but has no notion of buddha-field Sastra (p 418a25) - There are bodhisattvas who, by the power of their superknowledges (abhijnabala), fly in the ten directions looking at the pure universes (parisuddhalokadhatu) and grasping their marks (nimitta) in order to adorn their own field There are bodhisattvas whom a Buddha conducts through the ten directions in order to show them the pure universes; they grasp the marks of these pure fields and make the vow (pranidhana) to reproduce them Thus the Buddha Che-tseu-tsai-wang (Lokesvara) guided the bhiksu Fa-tseu (Dharmakara) across the ten directions and showed him the pure universes384 Sometimes there are bodhisattvas who, reminaing in their own original field (maulaksetra) use the divine eye (divyacaksus) and see the pure universes in the ten directions; at first they grasp their pure marks, then, conceiving a mind of detachment (asangacitta), they return to indifferernce (upeksa) 4 Sutra - Tesam buddhaksetranam yathadrstanam svaksetraparinispadanata // yad bodhisattva isvaracakravartibhumau sthitas trisahasramahasahasralokadhatum samkramati svaksetram ca parinispadayati / Constructing his own field on the model of the buddha-fields previously seen - The bodhisattva in the level of the cakravartin king goes everywhere in the trisahasramahasahasra-lokadhatu and constructs his own field Sastra (p 418b3) - As has previously been said (p 1923F), the eighth ground is called the level of the cakravartin Just as the precious wheel (ratnackara) of the cakravartin king goes everywhere without <2433> encountering any obstacle (avarana) or hindrance (nivarana) or enemy (amitra), so the bodhisattva in this [eighth] ground can cause the Jewel of the Dharma (dharmaratna) to rain down and fulfill the wishes of beings without anything obstructing him He is also able to grasp the marks (nimitta) of the pure fields that he has seen and build (parinispadayati) his own field on their model 5 Sutra - Buddhakayayathabhutapratyaveksanata // ya dharmakayayathabhutapratyaveksanata / ime panca dharmah paripurayitavyah // 384 An allusion to the wanderings of the bhiksu Dharmakara, the future Amitabha, whom the buddha Lokesvara led through the ten directions to show him the pure lands: this is the subject of the Sukhavativyuhas; see above, p 601F, n 1 2019Seeing the body of the Buddhas in conformity with reality - It is seeing in conformity with the reality of the dharmakaya Those are the five dharmas to be completely fulfilled Sastra (p 418b7) - The bodhisattva sees the bodies of the Buddhas like a magic show (maya), like a metamorphosis (nirmana) This body is not part (na samgrhita) of the five skandhas (pancaskandha), the twelve bases of consciousness (dvadasayatana), the eighteen elements (astadasadhatu); his dimensions, his various colors [are purely subjective]: they are adjusted to the visions which beings have as a result of actions of their previous lives (purvajanmakarman) In the present passage, the Buddha himself says thatseeing the Buddha is seeing the dharmakaya385 1 Sutra - Punar aparam subute bodhisattvena mahasattvenastamyam bhumau vartamanena panca dharmah paripurayitavyah / yaduta indriyaparaparajnanata // ya dasasu buddhabalesu sthitva sarvasattvanam indriyaparaparajnanata / Furthermore, O Subhuti, the bodhisattva-mahasattva in the eighth ground should completely fulfill five dharmas, namely: <2434> knowing the extent of the spiritual faculties - Established in the ten powers of the Buddha, the bodhisattva knows the faculties of all beings, superior or inferior Sastra (p 418b12) - As has been said in regard to the ten powers (1541-1545F), the bodhisattva knows first the functioning of the minds (cittapravrtti) of all beings: he knows those who are of weak faculties (mrdvindriya), those who are of keen faculties (tiksnendriya), those in whom generosity (dana) predominates and those in whom wisdom (prajna) predominates Basing himself on these predominances, he saves beings 2 Sutra - Buddhaksetraparisodhanata // ya sattvacittaparisodhanata / Purifying the buddha-field - This is purifying the minds of beings Sastra (p 418b14) - There are two ways of purifying: i) the bodhisattva purifies himself; ii) he purifies the minds of beings to make them follow the pure Path (parisuddhamarga) By means of this twofold purification of others and himself, the bodhisattva can purify his buddha-field as he wishes (yatheccham) 3 Sutra - Mayopamasamadher samapadanam // yatra samadhau sthitva bodhisattvah sarvah kriyah karoti / na casya cittam kvacid dharme pravartate / 385 In Samyutta, III, p 120, the Buddha says to Vakkali: Alam Vakkali kim te imina putikayrna ditthena Yo kho Vakkali dhammam passati so mam passati; yo mam passati so dhammam passati - What would be the use of seeing this body of rottenness? He who sees the Dharma, sees me; he who see me, sees tha Dharma There are many analogous texts in the Agamas and especially in Ekottara; cf Hobogirin, II, p 176-177, sv Busshin 2020Concentrating oneself in the magic-like concentration - Staying in this concentration, the bodhisattva accomplishes all activities, but his mind bears upon none Sastra (p 418b17) - The magician (mayakara) to some extent fills the universe with magical fictive objects: armies consisting of the four elements (caturangabala), palaces and cities, food and drink, singing and dancing, killings and calamities, etc In the same way also, the bodhsattva established in this concentration fills the universes of the ten directions with his metamorphoses: first he makes gifts (dana) and satisfies beings; then he preaches the Dharma (dharmam desayti), makes conversions (paripacayati) and destroys the three bad destinies (durgati); finally he establishes beings in the Three Vehicles (yanatraya): in all these beneficent acitivities, not a single one fails The mind of the bodhisattva remains motionless (acala) and he no longer grasps objects of the mind (cittanimittani nodgrhnati) <2435> 4 Sutra - Abhiksnah samadhih // yo bodhisattvasya vipakajah samadhih / Perpetual concentration - In the bodhisattva, it is the concentration resulting from retribution Sastra (p 418b24) - Having obtained the concentration like a magic show (mayopamasamadhi), the bodhisattva accomplishes all his activities [by means of effort] and with its help Now it is a matter of the [innate] concentration resulting from retribution (vipakaja) at the moment of passing into a [new] existence (bhavasamkranti)386 In the same way that a person sees visibles (rupa) without having recourse to the power of the mind, so the bodhisattva who is established in this [innate] concentration saves beings It easily surpasses the concentration like a magic show, for it spontaneously (svatas) accomplishes its role without any help Thus, among those who seek for wealth, some obtain it thanks to some help, but others obtain it spontaneously 5 Sutra - Yatha yatha sattvanam kusalamulaparinispattir bhavati tatha tathatmabhavam parigrhnati // yad bodhisattvo yatha yatha sattvanam kusalamulaparinispattir bhavati tatha tatha samcintyatmabhavam parigrhnati sattvams ca paripacayati // ime subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvenastamyam bhumau vartamanena panca dharmah paripurayitavyah / According to such and such a degree of achievement that the roots of good of beings have, the bodhisattva assumes such and such a form of existence - According to whether the roots of good of beings have such and such a degree of achievement, the bodhisattva knowingly assumes such and such a form of existence and ripens beings 386 This is the place to distinguish the samadhis acquired by effort (prayogika) in the course of the present existence from the innate samadhis (upapattipratilambhika) inherited from earlier existences as fruits of retribution (vipakaja) 2021These, O Subhuti, are the five dharmas which the bodhisattva-mahasattva residing in the eighth ground must fulfill completely Sastra (p 318b29) - The bodhisattva has thus acquired the two kinds of concentration (samadhi) and the two kinds of superknowledge (abhijna): those that are acquired by practice (bhavanapratilambhika) and those that are acquired by retribution (vipakapratilambhika) He knows that henceforth he will assume a [new] form of existence (atmabhava) with such a body, such a voice, such nidana, by such a path and by such means (upaya) He will even go so far as to assume an animal form of existence in order to convert and save beings <2436> Bhumi IX 1 Sutra - Punar aparam subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvena navamyam bhumau vartamanena dvadasadharmah paripurayitavyah Katame dvadasa  Furthermore, O Subhuti, the bodhisattva-mahasattva in the ninth ground must completetly fulfill twelve dharmas What are these twelve? In universes infinite in number, the bodhisattva takes hold of the class of beings capable of being converted (vineyabhaga) - In the innumerable universes of the ten directions, the bodhisattva liberates (vimocayati) the beings capable of being saved in accord with the Buddha’s teachings Sastra (p 418c4) - In the innumerable incalculable universes (lokadhatu) of the ten directions there are beings in the six destinies (saḍgati); the bodhisattva [of the ninth ground] ripens (paripacayati) those who are capable of being saved and saves them There are three kinds of universes (lokadhatu): the pure (parisuddha), the impure (aparisuddha) and the mixed ones (misra) Of the beings living in these three types of universe, some have the privilege of being able to be saved; it is those that the bodhisattva takes hold of One lights a lamp (dipa) for those who have eyes and not for blind people (andha); in the same way, the bodhisattva [ripens only] those who already fulfill the causes and conditions [of salvation] or who are beginning to fulfill them Furrthermore, a trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu [containing a billion universes of four continents (caturdvipaka)387] constitutes one single lokadhatu These universes arise and disappear at the same time Lokadhatus of the same type present in the ten directions, in number equal to the sands of the Ganges, form one single buddhalokadhatu Buddhalokadhatus of the same type, in number equal to that of the sands of the Ganges, form an ocean (samudra) of buddhalokadhatus Oceans of buddhalokadhatus of the same type, present in the ten directions in number equal to that of the sands of the Ganges, form a seed (bija) of buddhalokadhatus 387 See Kosa, III, p 170 2022Seeds of the same type, innumerable in the ten directions, form a buddhaksetra In all these lokadhatus, the bodhisattva takes hold of a class of beings, the class of those who are to be saved by a Buddha <2437> 2 Sutra - Pranidhanaparigrahah // sannam paramitanam paripurnatvat / All obtain according their wishes - Because of the fullness of the perfections of the bodhisattva Sastra (p 418c16) -Merits (punya) and wisdom (prajna) are complete (paripurna) in this bodhisattva; this is why there is no aspiration (pranidhana) that he does not realize Learning that in immense and infinite universes there are masses of beings to be saved, one is afraid of not succeeding in doing so This is why the sutra here is speaking of the success in aspirations (pranidhanasamrddhi) [The bodhisattva is assured of success] since, as the Buddha says here the bodhisattva fulfills the six perfections completely (sannam paramitanam paripurnatvat) The first five perfections represent the fulfillment of merits (punyaparipuri); wisdom (prajna) respresents the fulfillment of wisdom (prajnaparipuri) 3 Sutra - Devanagaksagandharvarutajnanam // yaduta niruktipratisamvida / The knowledge of the languages spoken by the devas, nagas, yaksas and gandharvas - This is by virtue of the unhindered modes of expression 4 Sutra - Pratibhananirdesajnanam388 // yaduta pratibhanapratisamvida / The talent of eloquence - This is by virtue of the unhindered knowledge of eloquence Sastra (p 418c21) - I have spoken above of the fulfillment of merits (punyaparipuri), the fulfillment of wisdom (prajnaparipuri) and success in aspirations (pranidhanasamrddhi) Knowing foreign languages is precisely one of the bodhisattva’s wishes Furthermore, the bodhisattva whose knowledge of former abodes (purvanivasajnana)389 is very pure knows the languages of all the places he has taken rebirth in Furthermore, possessing the knowledge resulting from resolution (pranidhijnana), <2438> he knows the nomeclature (namavidhana?) and deliberately makes up all kinds of words (aksara) and expressions (vac) Furthermore, the bodhisattva who has obtained the concentration explaining the language of beings (sattvabhilapanirmocanasamadhi) penetrates all languages without hundrance 388 Article omitted in the Chinese version, but appearing in the Pancavimsati, p 217, l 14 The pratisamvids alluded to here are defined above, p 1616-1624F 389 Cf p 1555F 2023Finally, the bodhisattva has himself obtained the four unhindered knowledges (pratisamvid) or he practices the four unhindered knowledges of the Buddha This is why he knows the languages (abhilapa) and the sounds (sabda) of beings 5 Sutra - Garbhavakrantisampat390 // iha bodhisattvah sarvasu jatisupapaduka upapadyate / The excellence of the descent into the womb - In all his births, the Bodhisattva is born apparitionally Sastra (p 418c28) - According to some, the Bodhisattva mounted on a white elephant (svetahastyabhiruḍha), surrounded (parivrta), venerated (satkrta), respected (gurukrta), esteemed (manita) and served (pujita) by innumerable Tusita gods, penetrated along with them into the belly of his mother (matrkuksi) According to others, the Bodhisattva’s mother, possessing the concentration like a magic show (mayopamasamadhi) caused her belly to expand inordinately; all the bodhisattvas of the trisahasramahasahasradlokadhatu, the devas, nagas and asuras were able to enter into it and come out In this belly there is a palace and a platform [The deities] set a bed (khatva) there, hung banners (pataka), spread it with flowers and burned incense; all this was the result of the meritorious actions (punyakarman) of the Bodhisattva Next the Bodhisattva comes down and takes his place there and, by the power of his concentration (samadhi), enters <2439> into the womb while staying as previously in the heaven of the Tusita gods 6 Sutra - Janmasampat // jatamatra eva bodhisattvo prameyanantalokadhatun avabhasena sphurati / na tu nimitany udgrhnati / The excellence of the birth - As soon as he is born, the Bodhisattva illumines immense and infinite universes with his brilliance but does not grasp the marks Sastra (p 419a7) - When the Bodhisattva is about to be born, the devas, nagas and asuras adorn the trisahasramahasmahasralokadhatu Then lotus seats made of the seven jewels (saptaratnamaya padmasana) arise spontaneously (svatas) From the belly of the mother (matrkuksi) come forth innumerable bodhisattvas first who go to sit on the lotuses: they join their palms, make praises and wait The 390 The eight sampads of the bodhisattva of the ninth ground are fully described in the biographies of the Buddha, especially in the Lalitavistara Two biographies in archaic Chinese, the Sieou hing pen k’i king (T 184) and the Tchong pen k’i king (T 196), used but little up to now, have recently been translated into Dutch by E Zürcher, Het leven can de Boeddha vertaald uit vroegste Chinese overlevering, 1978 These texts show much of linguistic and historical interest They inform us about the hybrid language, semi-scholarly, semi-popular, used at the time of the later Han by the Buddhist propaganda in China, and we learn what the first missionaries thought was proper to reveal of the life of the Buddha to people foreign not only in mind but in speech For this language, see also E Zürcher, Late Han Vernacular Elements in the Earliest Buddhiost translations, 1977, p 177-203 2024bodhisattvas and also the devas, nagas, asuras, rsis, aryas and noble ladies join their palms and wholeheartedly wish to see the birth of the Bodhisattva Next, the Bodhisattva comes out of the right side of his mother like the full moon emerging from the clouds He emits a great brilliance that lights up immense universes At the same moment, a great voice is heard in the universes of the ten directions that proclaims: In that place, the Bodhisattva is in his last lifetime (caramabhavika) Sometimes there are bodhisattvas who arise apparitionally (upapaduka) on the lotuses In regard to the four wombs (yoni),391 the Bodhisattva is born from the chorion (jarayuja) or he is of apparitional birth (upapaduka) In regard to the four castes of men (jati), the Bodhisattva is born either into the ksatriya caste or in that of the brahmana, for these two castes are honored by men 7 Sutra - Kulasampat // yad bodhisattvah ksatriyakulesu brahmanakulesu va pratyajayate / The excellence of the family - The Bodhisattva takes birth into a ksatriya family or a brahmana family Sastra (p 419a17) -Brahmana families have wisdom (prajna); ksatriya families have power (bala) <2440> The brahmana favors the future life (paraloka); the ksatriya favors the present life (ihaloka): both families are useful in the world; this is why the Bodhisattva is born among them There is also the worthy family of the Dharma (dharmakula), that of the non-regressing adepts (avaivartika)392 Taking birth in these families is the excellence of the family 8 Sutra - Gotrasampat // yad bodhisattvo yasmad gotrat purvaka bodhisattva abhuvams tatra gotre pratyajayate / The excellence of the clan - The Bodhisattva is born into the clan coming from the Bodhisattvas of the past Sastra (p 419a21) - When the Bodhisattva is still in the Tusita heaven, he examines (vilokayati) the world, asking himself which clan is the most noble in order to welcome a being; this is the clan in which he takes birth Thus, among the last seven Buddhas, the first three were born into the Kaunḍinya clan, the following three into the Kasyapa clan and the Buddha Sakyamuni into the Gautama clan 391 Beings are born from an egg (anḍa), chorion (jaraya), exudation (samsveda) or are of apparitional birth (upapaduka): Digha, III, p 230; Majjhima, I, p 73, etc 392 The bodhisattvas of the eighth ground 2025Furthermore, the Bodhisattva who begins with the strength of high aspiration (adhyasayadrḍhata)393 [is born] into the clan of the Buddhas (buddhagotra) For the others, acquiring the conviction that dharmas do not arise (anutpattikadharmaksantipratilabdha) would be the clan of the Buddha for it is then that the Bodhisattva acquires a partial influx of the knowledge of all the aspects (sarvakarajnata) Compare this stage with the gotrabhumi in the sravaka system 9 Sutra - Parivarasampat // yad bodhisattvo mahasattvo bodhisattvaparivara eva bhavati / Excellence of the entourage - The Bodhisattva-mahasattva has an entourage consisting only of bodhisattvas Sastra (p 419a28) - [Those who surround the bodhisattva of the ninth ground] are wise men, good men who, from lifetime to lifetime have accumulated merit In the present passage, the Buddha himself says that the entourage is composed solely of bodhisattvas Thus, it is said in the Pou-k’o-sseu-yi king <2441> [Acintyasutra, or Ganḍavyuha) that Kiu-p’i-ye (Gopiya or Gopa) was a great bodhisattva394 The whole entourage is in the level of the non-regressing bodhisattvas (avaivartikabhumi) These bodhisattvas, by the magical power (vikurvanabala) of the concentration of means (upayabala), change into men (purusa) or women (stri) and together form the entourage of the bodhisattva of the ninth ground] They are like the treasurer-jewel (grhapatiratna)395 of a cakravartin king: he is a yaksa or an asura, but he takes the form of a man in order to workwith men396 393 As we have seen, high aspiration (adhyasaya) is the first of ten preparations (parikarma) to be fulfilled in the first bhumi 394 Sudhana, son of a notable man who had produced the mind of anuttara samyaksambodhi, wanted to know how to attain it definitively, so he traveled through various Indian lands and consulted a large number of sages At Kapilavasti he met Gopa, a daughter of the sakyas, who gave him some precious information about the practices of the bodhisattva This meeting is mentioned in the Ganḍavyuha, ed D T Suzuki, p 390 (= Avatamsaka,T 279, k 75, p 406c7-10): Atha khalu Sudhanah srestidaraka yena Gopa sakyakanya tenopasamkramya Gopayah sakyakanyayah kramatalayoh sarirena pranipatotthaya puratah pranjalih sthitvevam aha / mayarye nuttarayam samyaksambodhau cittam utpaditam na ca janami katham bodhisattvah samsare samsaranti samsaradosais ca na lipyante / Gopa (Gopi, Gopika) knew Sakyamuni when the latter was still living at home and was indulging in pleasure According to some sources, notably the Traite (above, p 1003F), she was one of Sakyamuni’s wives After her death, she was reborn in the Trayastrimsa heaven where she was known by the name of the devaputra Gopaka It was in this form that she appears in the Suramgamasamadhisutra, French transl, p 172-178 To Drḍhamati, who asks her why she has changed her woman’s body, she answers that the distinctions between the sexes is purely imaginary, all dharmas being of one taste and without duality The precise teachings that she gave Sudhana on the ten qualities of the bodhisattva are evidence that she herself was a great bodhisattva of the ninth ground Having shed her body of flesh, she was clothed with a body born of the fundamental element (dharmathatuja kaya), free of marks and particularly of sexual characteristics But for the good of beings and out of skillful means (upaya), this great bodhisattva appears under the most varied of forms 395 The grhapatiratna, rendered here by the characters kiu-che-pao, is the sixth of the seven jewels of a cakravartin king (Digha, II, p 173-177; Majjhima, II, p 134; III, p 172-176; Mahavastu, II, p 158, l 16) This was not strictly speaking 2026 10 Sutra - Abhiniskaramanasampat // yad bodisattvah pravrajyasamaye nekaih sattvakotiniyutasatasahasraih sardham abhiniskramati grhat / te ca sattva niyata bhavanti trisu yanesu / <2442> Excellence of departure - The bodhisattva leaving the world goes forth from home with innumerable hundreds of thousands of millions of beings, and these beings are predestined to the Three Vehicles Sastra (p 419b4) - Thus one night in his palace, the Bodhisattva Sakyamuni saw that his courtesans were like corpses The devas and the asuras of the ten directions, bearing banners (pataka) and flowers (puspa) came to offer them to him and, bearing themselves respectfully on meeting him, escorted him outside Then Tch’ö-ni (Chandaka), despite the orders he had previously received from king Tsing-fan (Suddhodana), acceded to the wishes of the Bodhisattva and brought him his horse [Kanthaka] The four kings, messengers of the gods (devaduta), held the horse’s hoofs in their hands while it leaped over the ramparts and left he city It is to detroy the passions (klesa) and Mara in person that the Bodhisattva, before all the beings, in this way demonstrated his dislike for the householder life, for, if an individual as meritorious and noble as he is abandons his home, what should ordinary people not do? Episodes (nidana) of this kind illustrate the excellence of the departure (abhiniskramana-sampad) 11 Sutra - Bodhivrksavyuhasampat // yad bodhivrksasya mulam sauvarnam bhavati saptaratnamayani skandhasakhapattrani yesam skandhasakhapattranam avabhaso dasasu diksv asamkhyeyan trisahasramahasahasralokadhatun sphurati / The excellence of the splendor of the tree of enlightenment - The root of the tree of enlightenment is of gold; its trunk, branches and leaves are made of the seven jewels; the brilliance of the trunk, branches and leaves illumines, in each of the ten directions, incalculable trisahasramahasahasralokadhatus Sastra (p 419b11) - For the ornamentation of the tree of enlightenment see above (p 2321-2322F) In the present passage, the Buddha himself says that the root of this tree is made of gold; its trunk, branches and leaves are made of the seven jewels, and the brilliance of the trunk, branches and leaves illumines innumerable incalculable Buddha universes in each of the ten directions a householder’ but a treasurer, as certain Chinese translations suggest: tien-tsang-pao (t 125, p 552a18), cheou-tsang- tche-pao (T 125, p 788a12, tchou-tsang-pao (T 125, p 807a4) Digha, II, p 176 and Majjhima, III, p 175 attribute to him supernatural powers: Tassa kammavipakajam dibbam cakkhu patubhavati yena nidhim passati sassamikam pi assamikam pi - There appears in him a divine eye by which he finds the treasures which may or may not have a possessor 396 Thus, a number of devas, maruts and nagas were in the service of Asoka and obeyed his orders: cf Mahavamsa, V, v 24-33 2027Some Buddhas adorn the Buddha tree with the seven jewels of the Bodhisattva, but sometimes this is not the case Why? Because the magical power (rddhibala) of the Buddhas is inconceivable (acintya): <2443> it is for beings that they manifest all kinds of splendors (vyuha) 12 Sutra - Sarvagunaparpurisampat // yo bodhisattvasya sattvaparipakas ca buddhaksetra-parisuddhis ca / ime subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvena navamyam bhumau vartamanena dvadasadharmah paripurayitvyah / Excellence in the complete accomplishment of all the qualities - In the Bodhisattva, this is the ripening of beings and the complete purification of the Buddha-field These, O Subhuti, are the twelve dharmas which the Bodhisattva-mahasattva in the ninth ground must fulfill completely Sastra (p 419b17) - In the seventh ground, the bodhisattva destroys all the passions (klesa)397 [and thus assures his own interest]: that is the excellence of one’s own interest (svarthasampad); in the eighth and ninth ground, he assures the interest of others (parartha) insofar as he ripens beings and purifies completely his buddha-field In respect to the depth and breadth of the two interests thus assured, the Bodhisattva excels in the accomplishment of all the qualities (sarvagunaparipuri) The arhats and pratyekabuddhas assure their own interest greatly but neglect the interest of others; therefore they are not complete The devas and the minor bodhisattvas398 are useful to others but have not destroyed their own passions: therefore they too are not complete [The great Bodhisattvas alone have] fulfilled completely all the qualities Bhumi X Sutra - Dasamyam punah subhute bhumau vartamano bodhisattvas tathagata eveti vaktavyah // tatra katham bodhisattvo dasamyam bhumau sthitah sams tathagata eveti vaktavyah / yada bodhisattvasya mahasattvasya satparamitah paripurna bhavanti / catvari smrtyupasthanani yavad astadasavenika buddhadharmah paripurna bhavati / sarakarajnata paripurna bhavati / sarvaklesanam tadvasananam ca prahanam bhavati / evam hi bodhisattvo mahasattvo dasamyam bhumau sthitas tathagata eveti vaktavyah // iha subhute bodhisattvo <2444> mahasattvo dasamyam bhumau sthita upayakausalyena satsu paramitasu carams / catursu smrtyupasthanesu yavad astadasavenikesu buddhadharmesu cara / suskavidarsana-bhumim gotrabhumim astamakabhumim darsanabhumim tanubhumim vitaragabhumim krtavibhumim pratyekabuddhabhumim bodhisattvabhumi atikramati / eta navabhumir atikramya buddhabhumau pratisthate / iyam bodhisattvasya dasami bhumih / evam hi subhute bodhisattvo mahasattvo mahayana-samprastito bhavati // 397 The klesavivarta mentioned above, p 2427F 398 Those of the first six bhumis 2028Furthermore, O Subhuti, the Bodhisattva on the tenth ground should simply be called Tathagata - Why should the Bodhisattva on the tenth ground be called simply Tathagata? When he completely fulfills the six perfections, when he completely fulfills the four foundations of mindfulness up to and including the eighteen special attributes of the Buddhas, when he completely fulfills the knowledge of all the aspects and when he destroys all the passions and their traces,399 the Bodhisattva-mahasattva in the tenth ground should be called simply Tathagata Now, O Subhuti, the Bodhisattva-mahasattva on the tenth ground who, by his skillful means, is practicing the six perfections as well as the four foundations of mindfulness up to including the eighteen special attributes of the Buddha, this Bodhisattva, I say, exceeds: 1) the ground of the dry view; 2) the ground of the spiritual lineage; 3) the ground of the eighth saint; 4) the ground of seeing; 5) the ground of the diminution of the passions; 6) the ground of the saint freed from desire; 7) the ground of the saint who has done what had to be done; 8) the grounds of the pratykebuddha; 9) the grounds of the bodhisattva Having exceeded these nine levels, the Bodhisattva is established in the ground of the Buddhas This is the tenth ground of the Bodhisattva Therefore, O Subhuti, the Bodhisattva-mahasattva has set off well for the Great Vehicle Sastra (p 419b23) - The Bodhisattva seated under the tree of enlightenment (bodhivrksa) penetrates into the tenth ground called ground of the Cloud of Dharma (dharmamegha bhumi) Like a great cloud uninterruptedly pouring out torrential rain, the Bodhisattva’s mind produces by itself (svatas), from moment to moment and infinite in number, <2445> immense (aparimita), infinite (ananta) and very pure (parisuddha) Buddha attributes Then, noticing that the mind of Mara, king of the desire realm (kamadhaturaja), has not yet been tamed, the Bodhisattva-mahasattva shoots forth light from his urna so that Mara’s palaces, ten million in number, become darkened and disappear Mara, irritated and vexed, gathers his troops and comes to attack the Bodhisattva After the Bodhisattva has vanquished Mara, the Buddhas of the ten directions congratulate him for his deeds; they emit rays from their urnas which penetrate into the Bodhisatva through the top of his head, At this moment, the merits (punya) acquired by the Bodhisattva in the ten grounds are changed into Buddha attributes The Bodhisattva destroys all the traces of the passions (klesavasana), obtains the unfailing deliverances (apratihatavimoksa) and acquires the ten powers (bala), the four fearlessnesses (vaisaradya), the four unhindered knowledges (pratisamvid), the eighteen special attributes (avenikadharma), great 399 In his translation (T 1509, p 417a18), Kumarajiva carefully distinguishes klesa (fan-nao) from vasana (si) by joining them by the conjunction ki, for, according to the Traite, p 1781-81F, the klesas are destroyed in the eighth ground by the acquisition of the anutpattikadharmaksanti, whereas the vasanas disappear entirely only in the tenth ground, at the moment of abhisambodhi This distinction appears clearly in the original Sanskrit and their Tibetan versions: Pancavimsati, p 225, l 10-11: Satasmahasrika, p 1427, l 11-12: sarvavasananusandhiklesaprahana Tib Trip, vol 18, no 731, p 146, fol 265b6-7: bag chags kyi mtshams sbyor bahi non mons pa tams cad spans pa 2029loving-kindness (mahamaitri), great compassion (mahakaruna) and the other Buddha attributes, immense and infinite At this moment, the earth trembles in six ways (saḍvikaram kampate); the heaven rains down flowers and perfumes; the bodhisattvas, devas and manusyas, joining their palms, utter praises At this moment, the Bodhisattva emits a great brilliance (mahaprabha) that illumines the innumerable universes everywhere in the ten directions The Buddhas, bodhisattvas, devas and manusyas of the ten directions proclaim in a loud voice that in that place, in that land and in that year the Bodhisattva, seated on the seat of enlightenment (bodhimanḍa) has realized buddhahood and that this light is his Thus, in the tenth ground, the Bodhisattva should be recognized as Buddha Moreover, in the present passage, the Buddha has specified the characteristics of the tenth ground by saying: By practicing the six perfections and by his skillful means (upayakausalya), the Bodhisattva has exceeded [the nine shared grounds] from the level of dry vision (suskavidarsanabhumi) up to and including the bodhisattva grounds and is now in the ground of the Buddhas This ground of the Buddhas is the tenth ground The Bodhisattva who thus travels through the ten grounds is said to be well set out on the Great Vehicle (mahayanasamprasthita) 2030";
